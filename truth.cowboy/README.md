# Truth Cowboy

This blog is where I talk truth, to the extent I am able.

I've had a hunger for Truth for years, probably most of my life.

When Truth starts to burn inside to where you can't keep it in,
then you have to talk about it. Then when you take on opposing views
they call it apologetics. I've become a fan of several Christian
apologists in recent years. So there's a bit of apologetics in here.
