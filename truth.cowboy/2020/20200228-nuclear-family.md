# Nuclear Family

Maybe it's time for El Verdadero to start blogging again.

There have been a couple of topics recently which demanded attention.
Here's one.

## Explosive Title

I heard the following four-minute Breakpoint podcast

https://www.breakpoint.org/was-the-nuclear-family-a-mistake/

I've skimmed the original David Brooks article. It's long.
The title alone will stir-up most of us (one way or another).
I quite agree with the points John Stonestreet states in the
BreakPoint response. Brooks makes some solid observations,
but his conslusions are counter-productive.

## Starting to See

This podcast has caused something to suddenly click for me.
Certain things that I have been struggling with for several years
are begining to make sense.

While we did not consciously isolate ourselves, I can see that
a couple of choices my wife and I made resulted in a "tighter"
nucleus with our kids.

I took a job out of state. We had been thinking about a move
for some time, partly just to give the kids broader exposure.
God provides! And we landed in good company, with a fantastic
and supportive circle of friends.

Being far away from extended family was not intentional.

## Shattered

I lost my wife late last year. Our nuclear family is shattered.

Our children had just gotten out on their own.
The jobs they have taken require that they live some distance away.
So now I'm in an empty nest which once housed a nuclear family.

Being far away from them is painful.
(A challenge before their mom died. That much more now.)

## Grandparents

I've always been *very* thankful that my children knew
all four of their grandparents.

I'm thankful that my parents never divorced.
Of necessity, they lived at a distance from us.
But we managed to visit and vice versa.

I'm thankful that my wife's parents never divorced.
Until that out-of-state job (my fault), they lived relatively close.
We visited often and vice versa.

Until that out-of-state job, we had it better than most families
in the Brooks article. Much.

## Generations

One thing I've always dreaded is life in an old folks' home.

My mother's parents lived with her and my dad in their latter years.
It worked, and it gave Mom and Dad an important mission at that time.

Coaxing my grandparents out of their home was tricky.
My sister managed it! They went for a "visit" to my parents
and just never went back.

When we went to see my parents, it became a four-generation gathering.
It was wonderful!

## The Next Generation

After my grandparents passed on,
my dad began planning to move himself and my mom to be near family.
(Meaning my sister and/or me and our spouses.)

When my parents relocated near my sister, her daughters were still
in high school. Having the grandparents in town was really great
for those girls.

## Rocky Mountain High

One of my dearest friends lives in Colorado Springs.
He moved there 25 years ago from Texas.

What about my friend? He's far from his extended family.
Everyone's different, and he's content to travel, so maybe the distance
is not a problem for him.

Meanwhile, he has two young sons that he's raising right there.
