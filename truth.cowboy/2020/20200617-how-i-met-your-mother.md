# Dating Advice for my Children

haunted, haunted,
I'm still haunted by that question my beloved asked me
just a few weeks before she left.

"Why did you marry me?"

## Get Ready

A good friend wrote a short great article on dating for collegiates.
Ready or not, here it comes! I think the generation of my children
are even more fearful than my own generation. And yeah, it's scary.
But get ready!

How do you prepare for this? In the circle where we reared my kids,
"dating" was deferred in favor of "courting". That's a good goal.
The culture would have you focus instead on temporary companionship:
have a date for this event, be escorted to that gala or celebration.
(Sam Cooke, "Another Saturday Night") Puh-leeze think more permanently.

My friend's advice? Pursue righteousness.

*"He who follows righteousness and mercy
finds life, righteousness, and honor."* -- Prov 21:21

This is our life as Christians: pursue Christ, pursue righteousness,
pursue God's glory. (I Cor 10:31)

Guys, you'll be very interested in this:

*"Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing,
but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised."* -- Prov 31:30

How fortunate we are, those of us (men) who have found such women!

But it's not all on the girls.
If you want to be a godly man (in a relationship) go read-up on Boaz
(Ruth chapter 2 and following), especially Ruth 3:10-11.
Be that man! It's more than flowers and holding the door for her.
Boaz really stepped up, attending to every detail in providing for Ruth
and their son Obed was the father of Jesse and grandfather of King David,
in the line of Christ.

*"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."* -- Prov 9:10

This is not actually that difficult. Fear the Lord. Be wise.
"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God ...", James 1:5.
Treat those you date/court as belonging to God Himself, because they do!
I don't mean it's easy, but that it's achievable for any who ask. So ask.

Be selective. Don't be afraid of being selective.

Easier said than done,
but easier done when said early,
easier done when decided and committed ahead of time.

## Make a List

What are you looking for in a mate?
If you're not looking, you still need to think about this.
Take some time, think about it, write it down. Do it now.

Do not date someone you would not consider marrying.

*Seriously.*

I mean that both ways: Do not date someone you would not seriously
consider marrying. Also, seriously, do not date someone you would not
consider marrying.

Above all, do not marry someone who does not know the Lord.
More than that, don't marry someone who isn't *pursuing* the Lord,
growing in Christ.

Make a list. (check it twice)

Considering someone you expect to live with for a long time,
*think carefully* about what kind of person he or she might be.
There are essentials. There are also "negotiables". If one of you likes
Michael Jackson and the other likes Coldplay, that's okay. If it happens
that you both like Chicago, better still! (But not a show stopper
if one of you recycles and the other doesn't.)

Think about where you're going in life. If your job will take you
across the pond, find someone who's amenable to that (or maybe going
that way in following their own path; wow!). Life is hard. Be ready.
Find someone who will bear the same yoke as you've chosen. Oh the joy
of carrying the load *together*.

Once you've written that list, look at it.
Be the person you're looking for (except for things which are clearly
balancing traits, like someone who's good at math because you're not).
Put effort into becoming what will bless your spouse. The fruit of the
Spirit is the best thing to practice: love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. The last one
is more than just about sex. You're gonna need self-control throughout.

## Live Life ... Together

The best advice?

*Don't marry someone you can live with.
Marry someone you* _can't_ *live without.*

That would be the answer to Marilyn's question:
"I married you because I could not live without you."
And life without her has been difficult.

Put that in context: remember the source of life.
Don't elevate your spouse, or would be spouse, above God.
And that's the most difficult thing about the whole deal.
Find someone you "can't live without" in a practical sense.
Be whole. Be complete. Be content. Don't set yourself up as needy.
Then when you find someone who flips your world upside-down, go for it!

Notice: I still have a pulse.
(Though some might fairly question if I have any brain function.)

God made most of us to live in union. (Gen 2:18)
He made *all* of us to live in community. (Heb 10:24-25, Heb 13:1-2)
Apologies to the hermits; you know who you are! To those who want to
put yourselves out there, don't fear.
