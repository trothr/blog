# Well Done, Gene

Tomorrow we're burying my father-in-law. His name is Gene Harvey Nerren.

Just after his 87th birthday he started to have heart trouble.
Got a new valve. That went great! But then a stroke hit him.
Five days ago, we stood around as he left us.

And now family have gathered from several states,
some quite far away. He was very much loved.

## Corono Discharge and Aircraft Markers

Gene let me talk even when I was wrong.

I remember a trip he and I took. Along the way, we noticed the
red balls on the power lines. He said they're for warning aircraft
of the presence of hard-to-see hazards (wires). I said, "No no,
they're for corona discharge when there's lightning.". There *is*
similar gear for corona discharge, but lightning defense uses the
*opposite* geometry. I KNEW that but failed to put it together.
Gene patiently let me babble on.

Later I realized my mistake. I was so embarrassed. 
There were many other times I saw him tolerate someone else's
foolishness with complete grace and graciousness.

Probably the most patient man I've ever known.

## Does He Have a Job?

Gene accepted me even when I was unacceptable.

When I think about the kind of man I'd want for my daughter to marry,
I surely want him to have gainful employment. But when I married Marilyn,
I was still in school. Some time long after our wedding, he shared with us:
someone asked him at the time (about the groom, me), "Does he have a job?".

One time I thanked Gene for letting me marry his daughter.
"It's been a wild ride.", he said.

## You Do Not Have To

Gene showed me how to navigate pressure tactics in business,
be willing to walk away.

I'm not a business minded person even now. (I'm all tech.)
But I vividly remember, and have shared with others many times, the day
we bought our second car. Marilyn and I had shopped, searched pretty hard.
Finally found a vehicle that was a good fit and at a good price.
But the finance people were dragging their feet. We waited
at the dealership for HOURS.

I got stressed out. "I've got to buy this car today!"

Gene was calm and cool. "You do *not* have to buy this car today."

I repeated, "I do not have to buy this car today." Calm flowed over me.

Eventually we gathered in the office of the finance lady,
who was still waiting on some mysterious call-back from corporate.
Approval? Nothing yet. Enough! We got up to leave. (Gene first,
then Marilyn and I followed.) "Wait! wait! He's answering now."

## He'll Rise First

My mom's funeral several years ago was a celebration. 
Her faith was amazing and her life was an inspiration. 
I remember speaking at the service. I Thes 4:16 came to mind. 
I said (to Dad directly), "She's gonna go first" (in the resurrection).

It's true of Gene too: 
When the trumpet sounds, he'll rise ahead of us. 

I hope tomorrow's services will be a real celebration of a life well spent.

He was a veteran. I'm thankful for the honor he'll get. (21 gun salute!) 

Oddly, Petra's "Godpleaser" has been playing in my head. 
NOT a band Gene would EVER have listened to. But the line, 
"I just wanna hear my Father say 'well  done'", really rings in my ears.
Gene is hearing that now. And suddenly it's hard for me to write,
too choked up to see the laptop screen.

Our loss is his gain.

I look forward to when we see you again, Gene Harvey Nerren.
