# No Leaving

This should be short.
Writing is time consuming, even difficult.

## Faith versus Social Media

I've been seeing traffic recently about faith being challenged,
about Believers being persecuted, about God being in control.

God is in control.
As I realize that, and (esp) as I intend to blog about it,
I realize that I might be called on to affirm what I claim to believe.

Scary.

## Tested

When I started college, I had a fear.
I was afraid that my faith would be tested.
Would I still believe when I got to the other side?

I avoided challenges,
but my faith was tested anyway.

After the fire of a state university
(versus attending a Christian school as some are able to do),
my faith was no only intact but was stronger than before.

I note with sadness that the son of a friend (and a friend of my son)
attended a Christian university and was greatly wounded. He has not
lost his faith, but he has grown bitter toward the institutions
which we American Christians had propped up in hopes of supporting
our posterity.

## No Leaving

God is God.
Jesus is THE way, THE truth, THE life.

My wife's cousin posted on Facebook about persecution.
This post is not about persecution, but faith permeates these matters.

Music affects me profoundly. I thank God for musical acts like
Christine and Scott Dente (as "Out of the Grey"). Their song "No Leaving"
describes lyrically what I'm trying to say.
