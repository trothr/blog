# Why I Like Donald Trump

Perhaps my favorite thing about Donald Trump being Presedent of the USA
is that the vitriol of so many unelected celebrities and ad-hominem
critique by armchair policymakers is aimed more at him and less at the
hundreds of innocent conservative people they normally attack.
