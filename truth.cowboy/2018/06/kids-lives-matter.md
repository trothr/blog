# Kids' Lives Matter

This post is about being thoughtful in policy where it affects children.
I don't set policy, but I sometimes lend my voice to the public outcry
over one thing or another.

This post is about being consistent.
If we claim to espouse one position in defense of children
with respect to one policy, then we should hold a similar position
in defense of children with respect to all policy.

## Call me Pro-Life

I'm what we like to call pro-life.
When it comes to the several-decades-old debate in the USA
about abortion, I oppose abortion.

It's about valuing human life.
If the baby isn't really a baby, then sure:
abortion is just a medical procedure and the fetus is just
a bunch of tissue.

But it's not a "problem", it's a child.
I don't oppose abortion on grounds of birth control.
I oppose abortion because it kills an innocent human being.

If you're "pro-choice", my argument with you
is that you value one life over another. If you're pro-choice
and you accuse me of making life difficult for the woman with a problem
pregnancy, implying that I don't care about her, then I say you're
flat-out wrong. I DO care! But I care about her baby too!
Why don't YOU care about the BABY?

If the life in the womb is not actually a life,
then I'd change my position. But all evidence is that life begins
at conception. SOMETHING HAPPENS. There's something unique when the
egg and sperm unite. Eventually there's a heartbeat. Eventually there's
brain activity. Eventually, unless aborted, there's an air-breathing
person. There's no clear line between conception and birth where we
can definitively say "not yet human" and then "okay, now human".

## Call me Pro-Family

As of 2018 mid June, there's an outcry about children being
separated from their parents as they try to enter the US.

I've heard many say that we look disturbingly like the Nazis.
That bothers me, but there's no ignoring the source:
the same group (yes, I'm generalizing) hate Donald Trump
no matter what he does. So it's difficult for me to hear
a legitimate point, like "the kids need help!", because *every*
point they raise is against Trump. (They hate him so much,
yet they'd accuse *me* of hate. It's ironic.)

Fact: children are being separated from their parents
at the border. Are the kids being mistreated? I don't know.

I saw an article which suggested that the border story
is not as bad as the outcry suggests. That encouraged me.
"Phew! We're not actually Nazis.". But it was published in a
journal with a reputation, and there's no ignoring the source:
was it fact or just wishful thinking by the author? Worse,
I hadn't read it well enough: the piece conflated legal with moral.

We are a nation of immigrants. I spent most of my life in a border state.
I *consciously* welcomed newcomers, even made some good friends.
Never the less, I'M OFFENDED by incoming who want to game the system.
(And don't cite people I might support who also gamed the system.
It's wrong no matter who does it.) These law breakers are hurting
me, my family, my friends, and the other newcomers I just welcomed.

Fact: children are often coached to perform.
Is that happening here? I don't know. And it doesn't matter.

Here's what I do know: Pulling kids away from their parents
is tough on the kids. If I'm going to call myself pro-family
then I need to stand for things which are ... well ... PRO-family.

## It's Not Easy

To get it right, our border agents must be empowered and diligent.

To feret-out the actual gamers means more work, tiring details,
laborious evaluations.

We have to start from the presumption of innocence.
That's a basic right of US citizens. It's not a right (from the US)
of foreigners, but it's fair (and right, pun intended) to extend it
to children.

This post is my attempt at consistency.
If I care about unborn children, I should similarly care about born
children. And I do. Whatever the nature of splitting kids from parents,
it's harmful. Not fatal, but still wrong.

Immigration has changed. It used to be that most immigrants
hit our shores for economic incentive. Lately it's refugees,
people at risk in their homeland, families in dire straits.
The sad nature of humanity means there are exploiters even of these.
But can't assume everyone knocking at the door is a criminal.

Fact: the zero tolerance policy precipitated this effect
(separating kids from parents). Some in the administration KNEW
that it would happen and CONSCIOUSLY wanted to send a message.
That's using separation as a deterrent. That's using children as pawns.
THAT'S WRONG. ALWAYS. That reduces us the the level of those who use
children (and adults) as human shields.

I was not opposed to the President's zero tolerance policy.
I was wrong. I favored (still do) strong border control,
but I did not know the whole story. I've changed my position.

Mr. President,
you set the zero tolerance policy.
You can make the separation stop.
Please do!

Final note:
If you're upset about children separated from their parents at the border,
but AREN'T upset about abortion, consider getting consistent. Start getting
upset about children separated from their parents, and from life itself,
before their first breath.
