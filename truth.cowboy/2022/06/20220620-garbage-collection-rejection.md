# Garbage Collection Rejection

Have you ever visited some cities and noticed uncollected trash?
Have you seen trash in the streets, marring an otherwise beautiful place?

## Not My Problem

We were visiting a certain *very well known* city recently.
I don't want to say which because I'm not trying to diss the place
or its people. But if I told you, you'd recognize it as symbolic,
even used heavily in Prophecy.

As we walked from our hotel to the train station, there was trash in the
streets. A lot. It was sad. Then as we rounded a corner there were three
or more garbage bins overflowing. More than sad: it was just gross.

Later, after a great meal at a delightful streetside restaurant,
we saw an actual garbage truck actually collecting from an actual
garbage bin. Wow! But some of the rubbish spilled from the bin onto
the street. There it sat next to two other bags, which the driver
did not gather. (He would have had to exit the cab, pick it up, etc.)
It's as if he was saying, "Not my problem if they can't fit it inside.".

## Symbolic of Sin

We have trash in our lives that needs to be eliminated.
In human culture, we say "we're just human". As Christians,
we know that the trash is a result of the fall. Either way,
it's gotta be cleared out, collected and removed.
Can't say "not my problem".

Sometimes I find myself too busy to immediately discard
minute-by-minute rubbish on my desk, especially when I'm heads down
with work. (Or maybe I'm simply disinclined to miss those rim-shots
with the trash can.) But it's got to be discarded before it piles-up.

Keep short accounts.
Don't let the crap accumulate.
It's YOUR life: clean things up before the mound grows.

Galatians 5:9 says, "A little leaven leavens the whole lump.".
But I John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.".

Don't be a garbage collection rejector.
