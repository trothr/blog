# My Testimony

I have shared my testimony of salvation many times. <br/>
Seems like I have to re-write it. In fact, as life goes on,
there's always more to the story.

## Ichthys

A friend asked about the "Ichthys" in my email signature. 
"can't wait to hear your testimony on the Ichthys `<><` in your sig". 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys

Another story that I heard (which seems to be missing from
the Wikipedia article) is that early Christians, engaged in conversation
with a new friend, would draw half of the ichthys in the dirt.
If the newcomer was also a Believer, he would complete it.
Persecution was particularly heavy in those days.

In our time, it's not any great secret, though it might not be common knowledge.

## Mom and Dad

It's difficult to share my own testimony without also giving some of 
the story of my parents for reference. Mom and Dad both grew up attending 
church in the stereotypical manner of Americans of that era. They were 
Methodist, but after they married, they attended churches of varying 
denominations. I recall attending a Presbyterian church ... but never 
hearing the Gospel as clearly as Billy Graham or (dare I say his name?) 
Charlie Kirk would have presented it. In all their years, in several 
different Protestant disciplines, into their mid 30s, my parents 
never got the story. 

## The Gospel

Why the simple message was not presented clearly is a mystery. The best 
I can conclude is that Western thinking had become consumer oriented. 
We avoided uncomfortable topics like "sin". We love easier phrases like 
"nobody's perfect". And Heaven forbid that we might OFFEND someone. 
The fact is, from Genesis chapter 3, mankind has been a fallen race. 
But even then, God foretold of a Redeemer to come, and that was Jesus Christ. 
The tale has more nuance than even the best human author can contrive: 
GOD HIMSELF took on flesh, lived in this imperfect world (corrupted by us), 
but never screwed up, never sinned. And yet, the authorities executed Him. 

Genesis 2:16-17 ... And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, 
"Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of 
the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day 
that you eat of it you shall surely die.". 

Notice this is NOT "the tree of knowledge" but rather "the tree of 
the knowledge of good and evil". I hate it when some secular minded 
people equate knowledge with rebellion against God. 

Genesis 3:6 ... So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, 
that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, 
she took its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, 
and he ate. 

They did it! They went directly AGAINST what God had instructed. 
That's sin, and it infected all of their offspring, you and me. 

Romans 3:23 ... for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God 

In case it's not already clear, YOU are a sinner too. You cannot make up 
for the wrong you've done, even if you think it's minor. Oh but you're 
not as bad as [name some notorious felon]. Doesn't matter. You're just 
as damned. One single link breaks the chain, and so it is with sin. 

James 3:2 ... For we all stumble in many things. 

Romans 6:23 ... For the wages of sin is death, 
but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

DEATH is the consequence from the begining. Nobody gets out alive. 
But there IS a resurrection. 

Matthew 25:46 ... And these will go away into everlasting punishment, 
but the righteous into eternal life. 

Romans 10:9 and following ... that if you confess with your mouth 
the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him 
from the daead, you will be saved. 

Amen! <br/>
(Which means thus I believe) 

## And Then Me

A friend invited Mom and Dad to a study group. At this discussion group, 
the Gospel was made clear. They both believed. They "got saved", a term 
with social baggage. Naturally, they wanted their children to also have 
this great gift. I felt like they were out to get me, forcing their 
new-found religion on me. But I knew it was right and after some time 
I too believed. I also got saved. We were all baptized, making a public 
statement of our faith. 

There is a certain calm in a life set right with God. It's not an 
absense of conflict, but a peace that is beyond understanding. 
(Philippians 4:7) There's still plenty of drama. Life is hard, 
but God is good. 

As for me, I was a nerdy kid. I began splicing wires as young as five 
years old. Before salvation, I thought God would take away my love for 
electronics. Instead, I have enjoyed a starried career in software 
and have been able to tinker with countless gadgets. But my life is 
more than just tech. My identity is way more than merely "engineer" or 
"programmer". It's the kind of complete life that I want for my own kids. 

## What About You?

God loves you. He created you, weaving your unique attributes to make 
someone like nobody else. You were designed to relate to Him, but until 
you receive His gift of salvation, you are at odds. It's so ironic: 
the evil voices tell us that we must be free FROM God and all His rules, 
as if, "Don't eat that, kid, or it'll kill ya.", is somehow enslaving. 
But the truth is that we're only free when we're WITH God. There are no 
rules to follow nor things to do (because we CAN'T do what is required). 
Jesus Christ took the penalty that WE deserved. 

Believe it! 
Swallow your pride: don't make it more complicated. 
Abandon your shame: own up to the truth. It really will set you free.
