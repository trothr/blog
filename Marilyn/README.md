# Marilyn

This journal space (this "blog") is a tribute to
Marilyn Kay Troth, my wife of 33 years.

She was taken from us at the end of 2019 on December 14th.

Marilyn was, by all accounts, an incredible woman.
For me, she was a most excellent wife.
For our kids, she was an awesome mom.

There have been many tributes. This tribute is rather intimate.
