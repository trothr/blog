# Lufkin

Back to where it all started.

We arrived in Lufkin late last night.
Today (Friday), Chelle and Martin and I had several errands to run.
First, we had to meet with Bob Klund, pastor of Believer's Bible Church.

## Believer's Bible Church

This is where we met.
First time I saw her, a group from church went out caroling.
We were in different cars, but I kept noticing the girl at the end
of the row. A few days later, in the parking lot of the church,
she rolled down her car window to talk, or maybe just to flirt.

In those days, my dad was pastoring this church.
I previously recounted the story of how he approached Gene and Jo Ann
for permission to speak with Marilyn about playing for Sunday services.

Bob's office used to be my dad's office.

## Life and Memories

Every corner of this town reminds me of her.
My time living in Lufkin was short, and then I went back to school.

We broke up once or twice. When I went back to A&M, she decided
that she wanted to be serious and *not* break up. I'd come to town
on weekends to see her. One night, we went to see Back to the Future.
The kids and I drove past a movie theatre today which is now used for
some other business. I think that's the one we went to back then.
Later, while parked in the driveway of her parents house, I asked her
to marry me. She thought about it for a whiel, then said "yes, I'll marry you.".

## review

I probably should alter this post after review.

My life is over.

My life with Marilyn is over. What I have now are the memories.

If my life is centered on Marilyn then shame on me.
(Because, you know, my life should be centered on Christ.)
