# What Danny Said

Danny and Lorrie Davids are some of our dearest friends from Houston.
We met them when we joined Houston Northwest church. We later participated
in small group Bible study in their home.

When we moved, Lorrie helped Marilyn with some of the preparation,
specifically the yard work. (Yard work is Lorrie's thing.
Her help really softened that load for Marilyn at the time.)

They drove up from Houston for the Saturday service in Lufkin.

## About the Service

 Spent yesterday celebrating the life of our friend Marilyn Troth with 
 her family and friends at her funeral service in Lufkin, Texas. I know 
 what people mean when they use "those" words, and why they use them, 
 but there was a lot of mourning going on as well. The pastor handled 
 the service with dignity and respect, and brought up a few points from 
 Scripture that gave many long-time Christians reason to...well, reason. 
 Marilyn's daughter Chelle and son Martin shared their thoughts and 
 feelings about their mom (and they're both incredibly brave; I would 
 have collapsed like a house of cards). Her husband/our friend Rick was 
 able to lift his hands in worship during the singing of "Amazing Grace" 
 (again, don't know how I could have done it). But what made this 
 memorial service truly memorable to me was what happened afterwards on 
 the way to the cemetery.

## About the Procession

 After the service we went to our car and were instructed to turn on our 
 lights and flashers as participants in the funeral procession. When the 
 time came we merged into the line of cars and headed out on the 
 highway. This is a six-lane divided highway that circles the city, kind 
 of like what the 610 loop does (or did, years ago!) in Houston. While I 
 expected traffic to stop and wait on our side of the road (because the 
 constables were making it so), I was surprised to see a number of cars 
 on the other side of the highway turning on their headlights and 
 flashers and pulling over to the shoulder. At first I though an 
 emergency vehicle was coming up behind them, but one never 
 materialized. After several more seconds both Lorrie and I came to 
 realize they were doing it because of the funeral procession. Ordinary 
 people minding their own business and living their own lives took the 
 time to stop in consideration of the life of someone they didn't even 
 know. This continued from the six-lane highway, to the four-lane 
 street, and finally to the two-lane side road taking us to the cemetery 
 gates. I had never seen this happen before, ever. I was touched and my 
 heart broke...but in a good way.

 After the graveside service Lorrie asked an attending constable about 
 what we'd witnessed. He responded that it is an "east Texas custom" to 
 show honor and respect for the deceased and their family. This isn't a 
 state, county, or local law mandated by legal authorities. This is 
 people, on their own, agreeing to inconvenience themselves to recognize 
 the pain and anguish of total strangers and acknowledging in doing so 
 that life is precious. And my heart broke again.

 Increasingly we live in a world where we are so busy managing our 
 careers that we can't even manage our families; where gaining more 
 "stuff" means losing more relationships; where taking time off to go to 
 a funeral, or a doctor's visit, or a child's band concert or dance 
 recital, is a detriment to advancing at the workplace, or within your 
 social standing, or even with other family members. Legislating this 
 type of action would most likely have the effect of fewer people 
 participating, or doing so grudgingly or for the wrong reasons. But on 
 a grass-roots level, if we could all agree to do something this simple, 
 two to three minutes of our "inconvenience" could help our communities 
 at least agree that life matters, and that the loss of life is 
 something we should all grieve over. After all, none of us gets out of 
 this world alive, and I don't see how being an as...uh, I mean, a 
 selfish jerk makes things any more pleasant.

## To Us

 To Rick, Chelle, and Martin: You still have our love and our prayers. 

 To the people of Lufkin: You have our respect. You folks have class; 
 thank you for being willing to show it publicly.

 (Lorrie will be posting a few related photos.)
