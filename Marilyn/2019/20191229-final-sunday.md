# Final Sunday of the Year

I woke up this morning with the worst sadness I've had yet.
Maybe reality is starting to sink in?

Went to church with Diane and Scott. "Doctor Bob" was up today.
He's Diane's and Scott's favorite pastor at Granger Community Church.
The sermon was themed on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. (Fred Rogers
was reportedly a Believer, not just a nice religious guy.)
Good worship too, but I couldn't sing.

## Music and Weather

Scott and Diane have the Amazon Echo.
The unit they have presents suggestions on its display, things you can do.
A couple of features of Amazon Echo that Marilyn would appreciate ...

    Alexa, play Motown

    Alexa, run Thunderstorm Sounds

Chelle created a Spotify playlist for the family containing tracks
Marilyn would particularly enjoy. Lots of music from the 70s, also 80s,
even 60s, and including plenty of Motown tunes. At times during her
hospital stay, Mom would bob her head or move her feet to the beat.

Marilyn LOVED weather. I remember being with her on a couples retreat in
Round Top, Texas. The place we were staying had a wonderful second-floor
balcony that wrapped around the whole place. Several couples were
sitting out there when we saw a storm in the distance. In one of the
services, Chelle also recalled how Mom would open the garage door
so the three of them could watch a storm.

I miss her love of weather.

## NFL and Movies

Distractions do help take my mind off my own loss.
The Cowboys were playing the Redskins. Good to see the Texas team win!

Ezekiel Elliott plays running back for the Cowboys.
Zeke's a Buckeye! We watched him help Ohio State defeat Alabama
in the 2015 Sugar Bowl, as well as many other OSU games.

Earlier in the day, Martin came with me on a walk.
It was good to get out of the house, good to talk, tech, Mom, life.

Later in the evening, Martin and I watched the parts of several movies.
There's a line in "Trading Places" where Dan Aykroyd's character says ...

*It was a dream, I dreamt the whole thing. It was just a bad dream.
 ... 
I've had the most absurd nightmare.*

I wish I could wake-up from THIS bad dream.

Today is
2019-12-29 Sunday
