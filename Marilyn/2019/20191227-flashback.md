# After the Party

Today is Friday.
Yesterday was a melancholy Day-after-Christmas.

## One Back to Virginia

Chelle left yesterday.
A long drive for her, but she made it without difficulty.

I had already decided to post yesterday what Danny said
on Facebook, so did not add to that.

## Golfing and Memories

Martin and I went with Scott while he golfed with friends.
Initially we were going to just ride along for fun and to visit,
but later Scott convinced us to try a few holes. It was good.

Returning to the Saddle Brook neighborhood,
we drove on a road called "Old Farm".
Christmas 1998, the four of us were here, got snowed in.
I drove the Windstar on the same street, then thickly covered in snow,
just for fun.

## Flashback, October 1st

October 1st was a Tuesday.
Marilyn and I had just returned from Virginia
where we had visited Chelle and Martin for Marilyn's birthday.

That evening, she started having sharp abdominal pain.
Our niece Billie had her appendix removed this summer,
so we first thought maybe this was the same thing.
But Miss Research (Marilyn) got online and determined it was
more likely her gallbladder. Okay ... thank the Lord for that ...
nothing serious.

Marilyn was in the Ohio State University medical system
for primary care. Her doctor was out, but the doctor filling-in
determined, "yep, gallbladder", and referred her to a GI surgeon,
Dr. Narula. That man and his team were proceeding through the preliminary
scans and tests, thinking they'd need to remove the gallbladder,
but of course treading carefully in case some less intrusive treatment
would make more sense.

We met with Dr. Narula several times. The last pre-op meeting was on
Wednesday, November 6th. As we left the clinic, they drew blood.
Next day, Thursday the 7th, Dr. Narula received the results of the
blood tests and called us. "Your white blood cell count is very high.
Go to the ER and have them call me.". So we did.

As I write, today is
2019-12-27 Friday
