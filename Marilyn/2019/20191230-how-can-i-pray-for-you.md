# To Pray for Healing

This morning I woke up less depressed than yesterday morning.
I guess that's good. Maybe the chamomile tea helped?

I tried to do a little work. Distractions help.

Martin was up, but then went back to sleep.
I like how he put it: we're here for some downtime, here to heal,
nothing scheduled for today, so sleeping late is okay. So he slept.
Got up around noon, well rested. Good.

## A Drive

It snowed today. Got windy. Got too cold for a walk.
I went for a drive just to get out of the house.
Found myself near the Martin's grocery where Billie now works.
(in-store Starbucks) Stopped in and got a cafe mocha venti from her.

I passed Ivy Court Inn & Suites.
Marilyn and the kids and I had many happy times staying there
when visiting Granger and South Bend. Stopped and sat there and cried.

Sent a message to the kids. Told them where I was.
"I miss her so much.". Martin responded, "Me too.".

## Flashback, November 16th

Marilyn was sent from the private room down to ICU
on a Thursday night. The doctors said she'd be there "a day or two".
A couple of pulmonary embolisms. After less than one day, they said she
could return to the private room, but ... like a hotel with no vacancy ...
there just weren't any private rooms available. So she stayed in the ICU.

Chelle and Martin arrived later on Friday. Come Saturday morning
(the 16th), I was on the phone with Diane. It was rather early,
like maybe 7AM. I realized she was loading up her car to go somewhere.
She was coming to Columbus, and WITH Granddaddy. Their intention was
to come lay hands on Marilyn. Their inspiration was James 5:14.

## How can I pray for you?

Chelle took the lead in spreading the word to pray for her mom.
She used all channels available to her. (voice, text, email, social media)

On Wednesday before the ICU, I had gone to the mens group at church.
The short story is that the guys laid hands on me and prayed for Marilyn.
Praise God!

I asked a growing number of friends and family to pray for Marilyn.
Paul Geisler responded, "Yes will pray" and "have been studying healing
lately". Paul wrote some thoughts which raised eyebrows, but all I saw
was the Scripture he included. That's what we pursued, God's Word.

James 5:14, "Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders
of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil
in the Name of the Lord."

We didn't have the elders from FBC, but Granddaddy had been Marilyn's
pastor. We couldn't all be in the ICU room at the same time, but physical
proximity didn't strike anyone as a problem for God. And we had oil
(essential oils). But this shouldn't be done TO Marilyn; it must be
done FOR her.

Martin went with Granddaddy to see Marilyn.
Chelle went with Diane to see her.

Diane asked Marilyn, "How can I pray for you?".

"Well I'd like this pancreatic cancer out of my body."

Unity!
We were as one.

Looking back, every step we took was the right step at that moment.
It was right to pray for healing, even to pray for a miracle.

So began prayer in earnest.

I do miss her so much.
