# Two Weeks

It's been two weeks.

It was two weeks ago today that Marilyn left us, that she left me.

I wasn't exactly watching the clock that morning, but the time was
between 6:30 and 6:40. THIS morning at that time, I was awake.
(Still not sleeping well.) So I knelt beside the bed. Couldn't pray.

I'm still in shock. Miss her so much. Can't believe she's not here.
Sometimes cry, but have so little energy left even for that.

## Knives Out

Last night, Chelle and Martin and I watched Knives Out.
The four of us had seen ads for this movie before Marilyn got sick
and she was especially interested in seeing it. Martin remembered
that we all had planned to go when Mom got out of the hospital.
Well, she's out of the hospital now, so we went.

Chelle's in Virginia, but we have a family tradition
of watching a movie at the same time if we're in different locations.
That's what we did.

We had three tickets, hoping Billie could join us.
But she could not, so Diane took her ticket. It worked out.
She had already seen the movie, but it was good to have her join us.

The movie was shown at 7:30 in Indiana at the AMC 16 in South Bend.
The movie was shown at 7:40 in Virginia at the AMC 16 in Tysons Corner.

Marilyn would have LOVED this movie.

## Grave and Grief Share

Amid other errands on Friday (yesterday), Diane led Martin and me
to my mom's grave. The place is Truitts Chapel Cemetery just across
the state line in Niles, Michigan. We didn't linger. Will go back later.

Mid afternoon yesterday, Martin and I met with Terry Cegielski.
Terry and his wife Sheila are "table sponsors" for Grief Share
at Granger Community Church. He offered his ear and offered
some suggestions from both training and from personal experience.

## Support and Memories

It helps to hear from family and friends. I opened a couple of
Christmas greetings and a couple of condolence cards that had
arrived at our house before we came up to Indiana.

I understand more acutely why people say this is a difficult time of year.

Here at THIS house (Diane and Scott),
in the back yard is a swing. My Facebook "cover photo"
is a picture of Chelle, Marilyn, me, and Martin
behind Bill and Helene seated on that swing,
in a much happier time.

Scott and Diane are also empty nesters.
Billie lives with them now, but has also had her own time out of the house.
(And is often dog sitting or house sitting and therefore not at home.)
Their walls are covered with memories, much like our walls in Grove City
are covered with memories.

Today I walked, first time in several weeks.
Marilyn and I wanted to start walking TOGETHER and regularly.
I walked partly to get out of the house, but also to talk to God.

Billie is dog sitting but stopped by for a few minutes.
Scott and I watched the Notre Dame and LSU football games.
Diane too. Martin and I are watching the Ohio State game now.
Between the movie last night and the football games today
it does help to have distractions.

I read chapter 3 of the Tozer book.
Marilyn's notes are all over these pages.
The material is hard to take because it's about pursuing GOD for ALL
your needs. I thought I was there, but I know I have a long way to go.

As I write, today is
2019-12-28 Saturday
