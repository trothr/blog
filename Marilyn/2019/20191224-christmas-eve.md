# Christmas Eve

Need a verse for today.

Kids and I arrived in Columbus last night around 6:15.
Martin went to meet a friend for dinner.
Chelle and I went shopping (but didn't buy anything).

Chelle took photos of the really beautiful sunset seen from the plane.
Is anyone else bothered by sunsets when experiencing loss?
Or is it just me?

## Laundry

This morning I took a load of clothes up from the dryer.
All of it was Marilyn's, so I set about folding.
Included were a pair of yellow socks that she got from the hospital.

In the closet ... the longer half is hers.
I noticed her tops. They're nice, but she made them look better.
Seeing all her clothes hanging there was hard.

## Packing

Trying to get packed to hit the road to go to Diane's
and Scott's place. Diane got tickets for us to attend the
Christmas Eve service at Granger Community Church.
Marilyn loved that church.

I've got that blasted Karen Carpenter Christmas Eve song in my head.

Kids slept until about 8:40.
We're trying to get moving early enough to catch that
Christmas Eve service.

## Driving

Grove City had freezing fog this morning.
It burned off by the time we hit the road.
By the time we got to Marysville the fog was back. Never seen
fog like this before. Lasted until we got to the 80/90 toll road.

Grief gives way to anger.
No place to vent the anger. (Not fair to dump on family or friends.)

Martin and I got to talk a little about our new life without Mom.

The trip took 4 hours and 15 minutes from the Kroger near our house
in Grove City to Diane's house in Granger (near South Bend).
Fast. None of us wanted to "just mosey" today.

## Granger Community Christmas Eve

Scott got tickets for all of us to the Christmas Eve service.
(The service is free of charge, but space is limited.)

Marilyn would have LOVED it.
We all liked Granger Community when we visited, Marilyn especially did
and wished it was closer to us.
