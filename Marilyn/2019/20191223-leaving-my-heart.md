# Leaving my Heart in Texas

The verse of the day is Psalm 34:18.

Woke up to email that required a quick errand.
Martin packed-up. Chelle did too. Then I got back and we
met everyone downstairs.

While I was out,
I was tempted to drive back to the cemetery but didn't have time.

## Lounge and Leaving

I think it was Matt who noticed how handy the hotel lobby lounge
had been for us all. Just another small thing to thank the Lord for.

We prayed, all ten of us together. "Thanks, God, for Marilyn.".
Then we hugged goodbye. Chelle made a point to get an up-coming
family reunion on the calendar, first or second week in August.

The kids and I passed through Cleveland.
I remember stopping in Cleveland for supper on our wedding day
on our way to Houston for our honeymoon. We stayed in Houston two nights
then flew to Colorado for skiing. Cleveland, Texas was on the way.

It was on that wedding day drive that I told her
we were starting an adventure.

When I married Marilyn, I got more than I bargained for:
her integrity was profound. She had little tolerance for BS.

## Hello again Houston

As we approached Bush Airport, we turned onto FM 1960.
This road runs the length of the Northern edge of Houston.
Our house in Steeplechase was just a mile from FM 1960,
though more than a half hour drive from where we were by the airport.

After we dropped off the rental car and were waiting on the shuttle,
Martin again commented, "I miss Mom.". It used to be four of us,
now it's just the three of us.

At the airport, Chelle got a large Aquafina bottle branded with
a Texas A&M logo. Marilyn helped me finish my degree from A&M.
She never pressured me, but always encouraged me.

## Ongoing Support

I got a TXT/SMS message from Wilson Tyler after we hit the road,
"praying for you and the family!".
Thanks Wilson!

Got an SMS/TXT message from Scott Schwahn while still at the hotel,
"haven't stopped thinking about you and praying for you.".
Thanks Scott!

The impact of hearing from these guys is more than I can express.

I do love Texas.
I think Mike called me an Ohioan this morning.
I corrected him, "Texan".

So we're waiting on United flight 3494
and I'm leaving my heart in Texas.

"The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart,
and saves such as have a contrite spirit."
