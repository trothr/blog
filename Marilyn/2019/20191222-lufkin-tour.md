# Touring Lufkin

Sunday morning.
Did not attend church today. (Probably no surprise to anyone.)

Said goodbye to Donnette around 11 and said goodbye to
Stephanie, Phyllis, and Kenneth around noon.

Mike and Barbara still here. Jo Ann too, of course.

Matt and Toni and Nia and Nyla still here.

What to do today?

## Around the Area

Most of us wanted to go back to the grave site for a bit.
Matt did not want to take the girls there. Makes sense,
so they headed straight to the zoo.

The girls did say that they wanted to see "the woods".
The train at Ellen Trout Zoo goes through wooded areas.
That should be fun for them. They had TWO train rides. Good!

Chelle, Martin, myself, along with Michael, Barbara, and Jo Ann went
back to Fielder cemetery. We cried. We found graves of other relatives.
I snapped a picture of the fresh grave, flowers piled high on top.
In the photo, you can just barely make out Marilyn's face on the little
temporary marker that the funeral home placed there. In the photo, I tried
to get the beautiful oak tree in the background. You can see Chelle's arm
on the left and Martin's arm on the right.

## Around Town

We headed to Reen Street, where Gene and Jo Ann lived for more than 50 years.

Before getting there, we stopped on Linkwood Drive, where Bill and Helene
lived when they were in Lufkin.

The Linkwood house is near the Eleanor house, the first home
Gene and Jo Ann owned. We stopped and saw it too. Marilyn was born there.
(Okay ... she was born at the hospital, but you understand, the residence.)
I remember Marilyn sharing a memory of chasing her big brother arouhd
the outside of that house.

Hard to believe she's gone.

And then we got to Reen Drive.
Gene and Jo Ann sold the place in 2012. The lady living there now,
Peggy, was kind enough to show us around the outside. Much has changed
after a couple of remodelings, but much is the same.

Across the street is the baseball field Marilyn and Mike and Matt
spent much time at and around when they were growing up. It is surrounded
by well wooded green space. Chelle said that Marilyn used to take the kids
and walk Brewster (corgi mix, family pet, circa 2000) in that area.
Someone has kept the baseball field well groomed.

Kids and I went to Jack-in-the-Box. They don't have those in Ohio or
Virginia. We find ourselves empty, poured out.

Jo Ann got to visit with her friend Dot Brookshire at length.
Mike and Barbara took her there, then caught up with us at Casa Ole
where we had found Matt and Toni.

## Most Precious

In recent days, I've told several people about when Marilyn and I saw
Back to the Future at the Angelina Twin theatre. After the movie,
we drove back to her parents' house and sat in the driveway for a bit.

Rick: "Will you marry me?"

Marilyn: "That's a pretty big step"

She thought for several minutes.

Marilyn: "Yes, I'll marry you."

Matt seemed to remember this, recalled that I had not gotten a ring.
I wonder now what the Nerrens must have thought of this guy who didn't
even have a ring. In those days, Jo Ann was going annually to the Dallas
market and knew where quality jewelry could be acquired. So we got rings.

While at the Reen Street house, I pointed out, "this is where it happened",
that same driveway.

## Remorse of Remeniscing

I cannot see when I'll get over this, if ever.
I DO think it was good to take in Lufkin and to share the memories,
but it really amplifies the loss.

GOD, WHY did you take her?

The three of us are so tired from trying to comfort each other.

We prayed, "Lord, please guide us in our new life.".

Tomorrow we fly back to Ohio.
