# Write about it

Today we're having the Ohio memorial service for my wife Marilyn.

My cousin Susan said,
"I wonder if you should consider journaling ... You write well,
and express your feelings with such sincerity, faith and hope.".
Thanks Susan. Here goes.

We just buried Marilyn's dad this past summer.
2019 has been a difficult year.

Marilyn left us this past Saturday (December 14th).
For those who don't know, she went to the ER on November 7th
(a Thursday). At the time, we thought it was just a severe gallbladder
attack, and she was scheduled to have her gallbladder removed.
Then the CT scan showed a mass on her pancreas and spots on her liver.

I'll put the details in other "blog posts".

## 33 Years

Marilyn and I were married for 33 years.
Where did THIRTY THREE YEARS go?

It was not always easy.
There were many times I feared that she would leave me.
There were times I thought I might leave her, but I couldn't.
Throughout our marriage, it was clear that she was just as hooked on me
as I was on her, so my fears were unfounded.

## Why Did You Marry Me?

A haunting question:
just before she got sick, we were in Virginia visiting our kids.
The four of us went to see the Downton Abbey movie.
As we were leaving the show, she asked, "Why did you marry me?".

I was really put-off by the question.
Told her I got obsessed, had to have her, could not live without her.
She seemed satisfied. The conversation changed.

On reflection, I wish I had said, "I didn't want to be alone.".
With Marilyn, I never felt alone. I felt whole, even when life was
not going great.

The phrase, "You complete me", is so over-used.
But that's how it was. She completed me. I am incomplete without her.

## Pain and Planning

Kinda wish I had journaled more and sooner.
Early in Marilyn's illness, I had a strong sense, "wait".
I think it was the Lord. I think He was telling me to wait.
I was genuinely trying to listen, trust, obey at that time.

Sometimes it's difficult. No surprise to anyone.
But I mean, sometimes it's hard to just make a cup of coffee.
I have to take things one step at a time. My sister reminded me
the other day to just focus on the next five minutes.

I won't be able to plan anything for a while.
As a result, my future is hidden from me.
I suppose *everyone's* future is hidden, but we usually think we see.

## Sincerity, Faith, and Hope

Today we'll reflect on Marilyn's best qualities.
She was always sincere. She certainly had lots of hope.
Many other "qualities" too; borrowing from my cousin in this section.
But her best quality was her faith: consistent, simple, and deep.
