# Glue People

Some people are like glue. They hold things together.
Marilyn was the glue in my life, in our lives (kids and me,
as well as others). So now I'm unglued.

## Just the Right Thing

Martin and I both had a rough day today.
I think his was tougher than mine. He's fighting a sore throat.

Being a mom, Marilyn would know just the right thing to do for a sore
throat. All three of us learned some of her tricks for various
ailments, but we do miss her when the need comes up.

So we had more of that doing things together at a distance:
I was at Granger Community Church most of the day, using it as my
office for the afternoon. Was driving home when I got Martin's call.
I said I was going for a walk after I got to the Bennett place.
He said he'd join me (same time, though not same city). It helped.

My sister recommended that I start reading Psalms.
I had trouble with Psalm 3, but the rest (up to 6 so far)
have been great, of course. I've always loved the Psalms anyway.
Fact is, the Psalms are all about joy, even amid sadness.

## Celebrate versus Commiserate

My sister advised that I recognize the 33 years Marilyn and I had
as a gift. I KNOW it's a gift. Just wish it wasn't already over.
I hate endings.

Today I realized that I DO in fact want to be happy.
In particular, I want to be happy about the life that we had.
So I'm anxious to get past the anger and bitterness. Need to let out
the hurt (like a poison) so I can take in the joy (like fresh water).

Martin has reminded me several times that Marilyn would want us
to be happy. One thing that DOES make me happy is this tribute blog.
I find joy in reflecting on her life.

During her illness, we wanted to give glory to God.
In the memorial services, we wanted to give glory to God.
I see now that in our "new normal" we want to give glory to God.

I received several encouraging phone calls and email messages today.
The last was from Chris King. He reminded me, as he does almost
EVERY time we speak, how much God loves us, loves ME, loves Marilyn.
I had forgotten that over the past couple weeks.
