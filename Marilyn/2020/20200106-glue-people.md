# Glue People

Some people are like glue. They hold things together.
Marilyn was the glue in my life, in our lives (kids and me, and others).
So now I'm unglued.

## Just the Right Thing

Martin and I both had a rough day today.
I think his was tougher than mine. He's fighting a sore throat.

Being a mom, Marilyn would know just the right thing to do for a sore
throat. All three of us learned some of her tricks for various
ailments, but we do miss her when the need comes up.

More of that doing things together at a distance:
I had been at Granger Community Church, using it as my
office for the day. Was driving home when I got Martin's call.
I said I was going for a walk after I got to the Bennett place.
He said he'd join me (same time, though not same city). It helped.




## Celebrate versus Commiserate

My sister advised that I recognize the 33 years Marilyn and I had
as a gift. I KNOW it's a gift. Just wish it wasn't already over.
I hate endings.

Today I realized that I DO in fact want to be happy.
In particular, I want to be happy about the life that we had.
So I'm anxious to get past the anger and bitterness. Need to
let out the poison so I can take in the joy.
