# Marilyn the Celebrity

Bet y'all didn't know Marilyn was on the air.

I was so proud of her.

Something this past week reminded me of her on-the-air times.

## KSBJ

I took a job at Rice University.
We moved to Houston from College Station.

Christian radio station KSBJ came on the air in 1982.
They played a great selection of contemporary Christian music.
We could hear it, with some effort, from Lufkin to College Station.
But it wasn't easily heard and it wasn't constant.

But *then* we moved to Houston.
Suddenly, KSBJ tuned in as easily as any other station.
Praise God!

I didn't know, but Marilyn had written to the station
thanking them for their ministry.

One day I was driving home from my new job.
I had KSBJ on the car radio. They read a letter from a listener,
some couple new in town, how much the music and programs meant
to them. The letter was signed ...

*"Love, Marilyn Troth"*

Marilyn Troth?!?!?
That's my wife!!!
Woo hoo!!! Baby, they read your letter on the air! Cool!

## KHCB

We became friends with Bob and Jan Tyler.
They were "missionaries" with Child Evangelism Fellowship (CEF).
Their mission field was the greater Houston area. (That's a big field.)

CEF's ministry led to my own salvation.
Carol Graham (yes, distantly related to the famous evangelist)
held a Bible club weekly in her home. My mom forced my sister and me
to go.

Side note: I fought this. I can remember one day, Mom insisted,
"You don't have to accept Jesus Christ, but you *will* understand.
Now get in the car!". I went. I understood. I eventually believed!
Yay mom!

Carol used CEF materials in her Bible club.

Getting back to Bob and Jan ...

Marilyn and I supported the Tylers. She also held Bible clubs and
summertime "Vacation Bible School" classes. She eventually worked
for Bob at the local CEF office. One of my favorite photos of her
is a snapshot Bob took of her at that office. So candid. So joyful.

One day, Bob had to go to KHCB for an interview with station manager
Bruce Munsterman. He asked Marilyn to come along. She went.
The program was an installment in a regular series, and Bob was simply
introducing the radio audience to the ministry. It helped to have a mom
on the program who had run CEF events in her own home.

Marilyn's voice was strong. She got a kick out of Munsterman
having to whip the knob to reduce the microphone gain when she spoke.
I really miss that voice.

## Dave Ramsey

We were fans of Dave Ramsey's "Financial Peace" series.
As an aside, I recommend Ramsey's material to everyone. Good stuff!

We attended a multi-week program at "the Naz" (the big church in town).
We didn't implement the whole program. (It would be fair to blame that
on my un-structured nature.)

At some point, we started hearing "the Dave Ramsey show" on radio.
Like many live programs, they took phone calls. Since we had still not
gone through the entire Ramsey recipe, we had questions. Marilyn wanted
to call in during the show. We could ask Dave himself. I said do it.

Forgetting now exactly what the question was, but I remember that
ole Dave didn't give us the thoughtful answer we were after.
(It was more of a common sense rebuttal, thank you, or not.)
But she got on the air yet again.

## Twitter and Facebook

Later, Marilyn "followed" various local
radio and TV personalities on Facebook or (especially) Twitter.
Occasionally she'd comment on a post and actually get a response
from the celebrity of the page in question.

I probably always got more star struck than she did.
But we both engaged with people regardless their social status.

As I've said, I got the better end of the deal:
someone who was naturally one-on-one and very private
but who would happily interact with someone with star power.

## remembering

Because of Coronavirus, I'm cooped-up at home.
Lots of reminders of my Marilyn Kay.

I think of our dear friends Jim and Jube. Even before CEF,
Marilyn had begun home schooling Chelle and Martin.  Jim and Jube
are pillars in the Texas home schooling movement, having endured
the early days when a truant officer might come knockin at your door.
They're celebrities too, but always treated us with the utmost
love and kindness and hospitality.

A final note about CEF:
This is why we set-up Marilyn's memorial
at Samaritan's Purse to support their children's ministry.
She loved children's ministries most of all.

Jan Tyler died of cancer a few years before we moved to Ohio.
Marilyn was devastated. Jan had been a real mentor.

I wish that she had lived long enough to hold her own grandchildren.
God had another plan. I'm trying to get in line with His program.
