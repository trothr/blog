# Three Hugs

For Christmas, Chelle and Martin and I each got a BlanQuil
weighted blanket from Marilyn.

## BlanQuil Weighted Blankets

Trying to remember when Marilyn ordered these.
A couple weeks or more before she went into the hospital,
they arrived. They sat in our dining room for a long time after that.

She was constantly ordering thoughtful gifts.
The kids both got that quality from their mom.

Heavy! I mean in a *good* way.
One of the BlanQuil sales slogans is, "reclaim your calm".
These are nice! Really effective.

Between dealing with the gallbladder trouble
and then the hospital stay, she and I never got to talk about them.
What exactly did she intend be done with them? I know she planned
to give them as gifts, just because I knew Marilyn. I just don't
remember the details of the order, what prompted it.

## Make them for Christmas

Chelle figured it out.
Mom ordered them for her, Martin, and me.
Maybe it's obvious to all of you reading this

We took them as early Christmas gifts
and went to Granger for the holiday after returning from Texas.
These things are really teriffic.
Reclaim your calm indeed!

Why did she only order three?
Why did she not order a fourth?

There are so many haunting questions.
This is another: did she know?

Similarly, there's a nice 2016 Camry now in our garage.
Marilyn picked it out. I picked it up. She got to drive it
a few times, but it's like she was setting things up.

## A Hug from Mom

After Christmas in Granger, Chelle drove back to Reston.
Martin stayed with me another week. When he returned to Fairfax,
he flew. So his "hug" remained behind.

Fast forward to January 17. It was Martin Luther King day weekend
(a three-day weekend). I went to Virginia to be with the kids.
I took Martin's hug, returned it to him. Had mine too, of course.
This thing is *so* nice to sleep under.

So many little treasures. Thank you, Lord, for these hugs.
Please tell Marilyn we all say "thanks". I miss her. We all do.
