# Forty Days

40 days.
It's been 40 days.

Marilyn was in the hospital (or hospice) five weeks and two days.
It's been longer since she left than it was before she went to ER.

77 days ago we were looking forward to getting help for her
gallbladder. She was in pain. When she came home from the hospital,
she was no longer in pain.

There is more to say, but not today.
