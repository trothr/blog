# The Pursuit of God

I've mentioned this book "The Pursuit of God" by A. W. Tozer several times.
(December 24, 25, 28, 30, and more in conversation) I've tried to find out
why Marilyn had it, where she got it, and with whom she might have been
studying it.

It's great material, but the thing haunts me. She never studied alone.

## Hard to Take

Tozer is hard to read.
For some, he's hard to read because of is 19th century writing style.
The words and (especially) the phrases are odd for readers
in the 20th and 21st centuries.

For me, Tozer is hard to read because he cuts past this life.
He quickly gets to eternal matters. I've always had an aversion
to thinking about Eternity. I want joy and fulfilment NOW.

Maybe better to say "hard to take".

## Beyond Circumstance

The Christian life is about relating to our Creator.
More than just our creator, He is all that matters. He is all we need.

Circumstances distract from eternal matters.
Countless verses in the Bible (both old and new testament)
direct us past circumstances.

THIS is where I struggle. Always have.
Since I first believed, as long as I've been a Christian, I've had
my eye on the here and now. Eternity scares me. God scares me.

## Faith

This book is more marked up than most books Marilyn owned.

It was Spring of 2008.

Marilyn's faith was always more consistent than mine.
As I write THIS, I realize that's probably one thing making the loss
even more significant: I knew a lot of theology (picked up by osmosis
from Dad) but she was better at living it, better at ACTING in faith.
It's like I rode on her coattails with respect to genuine FAITH.

At the end of each chapter of this book is a prayer.
From the prayer at the end of chapter 8, there's this:

*Rise, O Lord, into Thy proper place of honor, above my ambitions,
above my likes and dislikes, above my family, my health and even
my life itself.*

Below that is ...

*Marilyn: 04/04/08; 04/08/08*

## Preeminence not Punishment

Understand what this says. Got never tells us to make ourselves miserable.
He simply wants preeminence, like a spouse valued above all other people
or relationships.

I KNOW THIS.
What's challenging is taking my eyes OFF my ambitions, my health,
my immediate happiness.

The day will come when I too will check out.
Then what? Only the relationship I've fostered with Him will matter.
YES, I'll see Marilyn again, and Mom, and Gene. But it's not about them.
It's all of us with CHRIST.

## Looking for Clues

So out of continued curiosity,
I'm still trying to find out who studied "The Pursuit of God"
with my wife. I guess I'd like to thank them. It was clearly a
great blessing to her, and that makes me REALLY happy.

It wasn't Amy Tipton. It wasn't Penelope Mishne.

## Fairfax and Reston

I'm with Martin and Chelle today.

Dear God, please heal us. Please comfort us in the loss of Marilyn.
Please fill our emptiness. You're the One who gave her to us in the
first place. Thank you for those years.

We three miss her terribly.
