# Dependable

Marilyn was the single most dependable person I've ever known.

What can you say about "dependable"?

## Organized

Early in our marriage, I remember a conversation where Marilyn said
something about "get all organized". I remember it bugged me. That
was then. Now is now, and now I REALLY MISS that organizational nature.

People are different. To say I'm "unstructured" doesn't mean I'm
intentionally disorganized. It's just that being structured is
not my natural mode. But it was Marilyn's.

They say opposites attract. My unstructured nature made it easy for me
to be spontaneous, which often helped Marilyn. We were well matched.

## Responsible

When we first met, I would not have realized her dependability.

Today I was packing for a trip, realized I'd be on toll road part of the
way. Had gotten an EZ-Pass several months ago. It's never been activated!
I had wanted Marilyn to do it, and she would have. (But at the time
she was in Corpus Christi.) In fact, she would probably have realized
several days that we needed to activate the EZ-Pass and already done it.

Even when you KNOW you've got something special,
you still don't fully know what you've got til it's gone.

It's tough going day to day without her, but many things are
working automatically because she set them up to do so. Sometimes
the most complicated thing I have to do on any given day is click
"skip" on an Amazon order. (Like paper towels, of which we have
more than we need now that only ONE person is using them.)

## Faithful

What's that verse? "Faithful in a little thing ..."?

There it is: Luke 16:10, "He who is faithful in what is least is faithful
also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much."

Marilyn was good about being faithful in little things and large things.
She didn't like lengthy projects, but she DID like seeing things wrapped up.

## Solitary but Breathing

It's really tough being in the house by myself.

Still unsure about what to do about the memories,
but I see that I'm learning and I know that I have to wait on some things,
not rush anything. It's compounded by having TWO down-size loads,
one from Bill and Helene and another from Gene and Jo Ann.
We got lots of treasures (each with its own memory).

Thanks to those friends and family who have called, sent email, gone to
eat or for coffee, and (especially) offered activities or suggested activities.
