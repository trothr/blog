# Kroger Alone

Tonight I went to Kroger alone.

Turns out that I hate going to Kroger alone.

## Dennis and Penelope

Got back from Virginia today.
The trip was good, though melancholy.
It was the first trip "without Mom".

Dennis had invited me over to visit, so I went to his place.
Penelope was out, but then arrived later, so I got to visit
with both of them.

Dennis and I have always gotten along. We have similar
sense of humor. He and Penelope have endured much loss.
It helped to hear their story.

These two really are special people.

## Kroger

Leaving Dennis and Penelope, I had to go to the store.

Marilyn hated to do things alone.
She even disliked going to Kroger alone.
(This is why I'm sure she didn't study "the Pursuit of God" alone.)

Tonight I went to Kroger alone.
Normally that's no big deal because I'd have her
to come home to. But not tonight. Turns out that not having her
to come home to changes everything.

## Memories

I was in Martin's room the other day, where I now have
some electronics and radio gear parked. Noticed a photo album.
Memories from 1993, a partially filled album, now frozen in time.

One photo that grabbed my heart is this ...

Love it!

While in Virginia, we went to church with Steven and Courtney
and their kids, then lunch, then movies. We also had time
to ourselves: the three of us together, me with Martin,
me with Chelle.

The drive down Friday was tough, hours in the car with the emotions.

The drive back today was tough, hours in the car with the emotions.
