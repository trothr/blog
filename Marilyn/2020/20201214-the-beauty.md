# The Beauty

There's nothing beautiful about death.

Some will tell you death is just a part of life.
But in Genesis 2:17 and other places, we learn about death,
that it's a rift, a break, a tearing away, a violation of God's design.

But God provides beauty even in the must ugly situations.
In Marilyn's passing there were many beautiful things,
some quite surprising.

## After a Year

Today marks one year since Marilyn left us.

I'm sitting at Martin's apartment in Virginia.
He lit a candle in her memory. It was Chelle's idea.
We spoke with Chelle by phone. I read Isaiah 40:31,
Marilyn's favorite verse.

*But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not weary,
they shall walk and not faint.*

I've been using the word "graduated" instead of "passed".
She is with the Lord. She has left behind things of this life.
It really is a promotion for her. She finished the course.
But if you've ever taught, you know how it feels to watch the students
move on. That's similar in some ways to how it is for us to stay behind.

## Surprising Things

Chelle noticed the Hand of God many times during Marilyn's hostpital stay.
We got help from my sister and other family. We got support from *many*
friends.

* she did not have pneumonia
* her ducts were clear
* she did not complain of much pain

At work, my management and teammates gave me lots of lattitude.

We had countless friends praying for us.
The men at church laid hands on me and prayed for Marilyn

These are beautiful things.

Her liver had taken a heavy blow. It started to fail.
When the liver went down, it took her kidneys along with it.

## Going Home

Years ago, Marilyn's mom Jo Ann lost her brother Philip.
She was not able to be with him before he died. I so much DID NOT want
that to happen with her daughter. I prayed that she could get to Ohio
before Marilyn left us. She did! Praise God!

Marilyn had said, "I want to go home.".
When all medical remedies were used up, I connected with the hospice team.
They drove her home.

Mike arrived halfway through the week.
Matt arrived Friday, bringing Jo Ann.
Diane returned, bringing Bill (my dad).
Nancy came to the house too.

The transport team put Marilyn in the den. We all gathered there.

Jo Ann said,
"You are so beautiful. I'm so proud of you.".

I held her hand the whole night.

At 6:34, she was gone.

We worshiped.
