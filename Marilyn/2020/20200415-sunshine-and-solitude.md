# Sunshine and Solitude

I opened the blinds this morning to let in maximum sunshine.

## Cold Lonely Morning

Woke up to 28 degrees (farenheit scale, of course).
Needed a little sunshine to warm things up.

The sun was at just the proper angle.
It had just come up. So I opened the blinds in the kitchen
and in the dining room.

Cold is cold,
but lonely is worse since the whole planet is shut-in ... still!

## Sorry Honey

Marilyn was a very private person,
to the point that she hated for the blinds to be wide open.
I would occasionally open them wide for early sunlight
but then reduce them for normal daytime before she got up.

It was a personal game:
can I get some rays in here before she comes downstairs?

I'll set the blinds to their daytime position shortly.
Really do miss her smile as she'd walk down the stairs.
