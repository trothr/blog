# Mornin Darlin

I got into the habit of dropping the "G" from "Morning, Darling"
as a personalized greeting to my bride. She always responded
more normally, but she never complained about the style I used.

## Last Text

The last txt/sms message I sent to Marilyn's phone is "Morning Darlin".
She was not able to respond. While in ICU, she started to get shaky
and couldn't work her cell phone. The last message I got from her was
"Done with all", meaning that the doctors and nurses were done with
whatever they were attending too and the coast was clear for me
to come back to her room. That was November 16th.

On reflection, that last txt from her is haunting.

## The Lifeline

I miss those phone messages.

The phone messages were our link when we were apart.
Hearing from Marilyn made it bearable for me to be alone
whether I was traveling or she was traveling.
It was the same for her.

Even if Marilyn was away visiting the kids
or on a lengthy stay in Texas, having the messages kept us going.
Voice calls would be great, but txt messages work when you're
having to be quiet or when you're not in a private place.
More intimate in an unexpected way.

## Love You

One of the last messages from Marilyn was "Love you".
It was November 15th, Friday night. I had gone home to get some sleep
and txted "Home now. Love you!". She responded "Love you".

Hated to leave, but everyone kept telling me "take care of yourself",
that it was the best thing I could do FOR HER. Okay. I'll go rest.

Next day I was back at the hospital, having to wait until the staff
was done with whatever, then got to see her. Every day, I'd say,
"Mornin Darlin", first thing back at her room.

A couple weeks later, one of the last things she spoke to me
verbally was "I love you.".
