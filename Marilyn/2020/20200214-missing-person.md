# Missing Person

On the fridge in our kitchen is a photo of Marilyn from Costa Rica.
One summer when she was in Texas for an extended time, I put that photo
on the fridge with the caption, "If you have seen this person, please
CALL DAD.". When she got back that summer, we just left the photo up
because we all liked it. Marilyn got a kick out of it.

## Visiting Family

I live in a big empty house. It wasn't always empty.
(And it's not really all that big compared to some houses.)

We bought a house that could be used for having people visit.
Our main out of town visitors were Gene and Jo Ann and to a
lesser extent Bill and Helene. They might stay in the guest room
if things worked out that way.

It was so nice having them stay with us.

## Jo Ann's Cancer

In 2007, Jo Ann fought breast cancer. She beat it!
She's been cancer free now more than ten years. Praise God!

In 2007, Marilyn went to Lufkin to help out. It was a big help,
no doubt. We didn't mind. (Chelle, Martin, and I) But we did miss her.
It was okay that she was taking care of Nana. That made it alright.

After surgery, Jo Ann was given oral chemotherapy for several months.
It was low impact but worked effectively.

Chemotherapy

2007 was a year of changes. We lost Brewster that year. (cancer)
But later we got Tasha. Both dogs were rescues.

## The Helper

If Marilyn was gone out of town it was usually because she was
helping someone. Around 1996, Diane was due to deliver Leslie.
Bill and Helene were already caring for Elaine and Gray.
To free them up so Helene could help Diane, Marilyn and the kids
went to Dallas. I had to work, but managed to fly up just before
my baby niece was born.

Nothing gave Marilyn more joy than helping others. It didn't even
have to be interesting or fun work. She took on the duties of clean-up
for our Sapphire EP (Home on the Rock).

Last weekend, I had to drive to Hamilton to get a radio part.
Made a couple of sandwiches for the road. That's the kind of thing
Marilyn would have done: make sure I had enough to eat and drink.

## Really Missing

I miss you, sweetie. We all do. I know you're with the Lord.
It must be wonderful. May God wipe away all your tears
just like He promised.

I looked for that photo.
Was going to put it into this post.
If I find it later, I'll update this post.

It will stay on the fridge for a while longer.
