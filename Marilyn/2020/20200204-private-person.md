# Private Person

I wish more of my friends had known Marilyn.
I wish my family had known her better.

## Private per Parentage

From early in our relationship, Marilyn described herself to me as a
"private person". I could see it: she DID NOT like to be the center
of attention. 

It was not until we'd been married twenty years
that I really understood. Somehow, I thought she got her privacy
from Jo Ann. No! It was from Gene. Here's the story.

Not long after we moved to Ohio, Gene and Jo Ann came up for a visit.
They were in their Class A Winnebago. We were still living in Hilliard.
Jo Ann and Gene stayed at Alton RV park just a few miles away.
We had gone there for the evening. As we were leaving, Gene started
pulling down the shades in the motorhome. That's not unusual,
but someone said, "there he goes", and something about his demeanor
clued me in: Gene was also a very private person!

I'm still putting up curtains and closing blinds at night.

## Insecure yet Secure

When she was younger, she was insecure. We both were.

I remember, when we were dating, looking over her highschool yearbook.
It was fun seeing photos. She opened up, in one photo kind of hiding
behind the group, "There I am, my insecurity in full force.".
(After all this time, that's a paraphrase.)

I was insecure too.
But when I was with her I was not.
When I was with Marilyn, I could do ANYTHING.

My own insecurities were blown away. She was the instrument God used.
I'm sure it went both ways. I know she depended on me. "I don't want
you to leave my side."

Together we were confident!

## One on One

Marilyn was also very much a one-on-one person. I don't know if it's
related to being private. Probably is. (That would make sense.) 

In recent months, between travel and other logistics, Nancy was often our
only visitor. She and Nancy could talk for HOURS, just the two of them.

Nancy wasn't the only friend. (Though she's been a constant for TEN YEARS.)
I remember her meeting with Lueanne, Penelope, others, and more in Texas.

Phone calls were great because those are usually one-on-one.

Marilyn became for me the channel to friends and family.
She'd be in touch. She had the detail and organization to connect
better than I would. Then being one-on-one, she'd get a more intimate
picture of whatever was happening with whomever. I had it good.

I sometimes directed communication via Marilyn, even for my side of our
family (my sister, my parents). There were several reasons, partly so
SHE would know about any plans. (She was the organized one.) But also
just to get them to communicate with her. (See the top of this post,
wishing everyone knew her better.)

But I still don't know who she was studying Tozer's
"The Pursuit of God" with.

## Loved and Loving

How can I say more than I've already said?
But photos around this house keep reminding me of the love we shared.

Our daughter, the artist, made a collage for our 30th anniversary.
She made another to honor Marilyn. In both, our clasped hands are a
prominent feature. I miss those hands.

To say I miss her is an understatement.
It also sounds repetitive.
Not sorry.

Tried to post this yesterday (Monday). Long day.
