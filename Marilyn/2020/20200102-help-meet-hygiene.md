# Looking Good

Martin flew back to Virginia today.
We had breakfast with Granddaddy before going to the airport.
I noticed a number of men at the restaurant with unkempt hair.
It reminded me how much Marilyn appreciated when I looked nice.

## Hair Cut

I forget now the exact day, but I got my hair cut at Great Clips.
The kids were in town, so it must have been a weekend.
Marilyn was intubated but communicating. "Dad cut his hair."
She gave a thumbs up.

I just wanted to look nice for HER.
Was so glad that she saw it and liked it.

## Help-meet Hygiene

Everybody's different, and Marilyn and I had our own weaknesses
with respect to clutter. One thing we both appreciated was personal care,
she especially.

In my job, I have to meet with customers.
REALLY helps to look nice, and I'm prone to miss a thing or two.
I miss having her to give me that double-check.

It was a two-way street.
We'd be out somewhere and she'd turn to me. "Nose check?"
All good, every time, but it was nice that she would lean on me
for confirmation.

## Miss Her Much

They you'll have good days and bad days.
Today was a difficult day. The up-side was that Jo Ann and I
could lean on each other (from a thousand miles away).
For the both of us (and for others, not to leave anyone out)
it still doesn't seem real.

I don't want to be like those disheveled guys at the restaurant.
Having to do my own double-check now. I'm relying on memory of Marilyn
for the reference, what to check, what to look for, everything in place.
