# Caladiums

We're in the global lock-down.
Aloneness is amplified.

## Get Outside

After a late start, I had a couple of "test" meetings
with people from the Grief Share groups to figure out
which services work best.

Still cold this afternoon, barely 40 degrees.
I'm so tired of the cold.

I noticed tar felt which had been scattered by winds
in recent days, so I went outside to put those back into place.
That exercise reminded me of the landscaping Marilyn loved.

## Loving Landscaping

Did she really love landscaping? She must have.
