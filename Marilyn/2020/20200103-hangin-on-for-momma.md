# Hangin on for Momma

Today we lost Tasha.

It was hard on the three of us.

## A Rescue

As a family, we were always dog people.
And we came to love doing rescues.

Brewster was our first rescue.
There had been some really bad weather in Del Rio.
I think it was the remnants of a hurricane, but I can't now find which one.
The timing of Bret seems right but the track of Charly fits better.

Brewster was part Corgi. Not sure what the other half was,
from looks probably Beagle. But he had distinctively short Corgi legs.
He was with us when we moved to Ohio. But he got cancer and we lost him in 2007.

## A Husky

We got interested in Siberian Huskies. Chris and Jessica (a couple 
from church) had several huskies. Marilyn heard about a husky needing
adoption. She and the kids drove down to Cincinnati. I named her Tasha.

Tasha was perfect for our life in Ohio. It snows just enough for her
to have great fun prancing through the white stuff in the winters.

## A Great Idea

Huskies are smart. To be honest, there were times when Tasha would be
quite stubborn. They're also more conversational than most breeds.
We've got numerous recordings of Tasha talking, more often singing,
along with us in concert.

When Marilyn got sick, I wondered what to do with Tasha.
Laura had come up from Arkansas to help care for Marilyn and got
immediately attached to Tasha. She walked her much longer than
Marilyn and I had beeen walking her. (Life-long hip displasia, so we
had shortened the walks.) With the longer walks, Tasha really started
to do BETTER. Laura and Jerry life with Laura's sister Cathy and their
mom, Dot, in a wonderful big house with 600 acres (Benton, outside
Little Rock). Laura presently has five other dogs, so it's a party.

I wondered if Tasha should go live with Laura and join the pack.
Suggested the idea to Martin.

"That's a great idea!"

More enthusiastic than I expected. And I didn't think Chelle
would be quite so quick to warm up to it, but I asked her too.

"That's a great idea!"

Well okay then! Seems we're all in agreement! Laura convinced Jerry,
then also Cathy and Dot.

## A New Home

Laura and Jerry returned to Arkansas on the 19th,
the day after the Ohio service for Marilyn. They took their
new pack member with them. When she got to Arkansas, she quickly
got in with the rest and into the routine. Things looked good.
Cathy and Dot really took to Tasha.

Living on Cathy's property was paradise for Tasha.

On Wednesday (the 1st), Laura said that Tasha was having
some trouble breathing and asked for our vet's number in Grove City.
I provided that. Next day, Laura got Tasha to see one of the vets
in Arkansas. Tough day yesterday. Today Laura and Dot got Tasha
to see their preferred vet, Dr. Tom, and LSU vet grad. He said it
was grim, so they had to put her down.

## Hangin on for Momma

Chelle reminded Martin and me, when we first got Tasha,
we were told she'd only be with us for maybe nine years.
But she stayed with us until she was almost 13 years old.
Chelle thinks Tasha hung on specifically for Marilyn.

Dogs can sense things. Some dogs are even trained to detect
health issues. It makes sense that Tasha could have detected
Marilyn's cancer and remained with us just to be alongside.
She was with us when Marilyn left. Good girl, Tasha!
