# Better for Knowing You

For the past several days,
I've had it out with God, yelling at Him, asking "why?".

Scott is producing the services at Granger Community Church this weekend,
two on Sunday and one tonight (Saturday). Diane asked if I wanted to go
and suggested dinner afterward. I went.

The sermon was about time, taking time for what matters.

What DOES matter?
Having coffee and tea at 7AM while watching Good Day Columbus
matters because it means time together.

## Better Together

After church, we went to Hacienda (Mexican). Billie met us there.

While parking the car, I was reminded of the insecurities Marilyn and I
both had when we first knew each other. As we went through life,
having her by my side, those insecurities faded away.

During the memorial services, and in countless tributes,
people were better for having known Marilyn. More so for me.

Across the table sat Scott Bennett,
a man with better groomed hair than mine.
I already mentioned how Marilyn changed me for the better
even in little grooming habits. (And here's hoping that's not TMI.)

## Never the Same

I've said that my own life is reset, like a reboot.
But I'm not the same. I will never be the same guy that I was
before being married to Marilyn. She changed me for the better,
like a wonderful tool in God's hand, permanently.

The verse of the day is Psalm 3:1-4.
Verse 3 reads, "But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory and
the One who lifts up my head.".
And then verse 4, "I cried to the Lord with my voice,
and He heard me from His holy hill.".

Diane encouraged me to read Psalms, and I was doing that.
Got to chapter 3 and got stuck on verses 3 and 4.
These were tough because they (or something similar) had been
verse-of-the-day at one point during Marilyn's hospitalization.

Marilyn was better for me than I was for her.
I wanted to do better, to do more. I should recognize that her lie now
is perfect, no improvement needed. Maybe someday I will.
