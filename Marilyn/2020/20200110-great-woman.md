# Great Woman

Behind every great man is a greater woman.

The story goes that the building contractor went to visit a site
and his wife was with him. One of the workers, who used to date her,
whistled and hollered flirtatiously. The boss said, "Hah! If you'd
married that guy, you'd be married to a common laborer.". But she replied,
"If I'd married that guy, I'd be married to the mayor.". In other words,
she could have taken him further.

## In My Corner

I unpacking the suitcase and putting away some clothes.
Noticed a couple new shirts she bought for me this year.

Marilyn made me successful!
She was always in my corner in the battles of life.

When I lingered in college, she's the one who helped me
to keep pushing until I finished. (She bought my A&M ring.)

## God Sightings

Marilyn often noticed subtle things God provided,
things most of us would miss.

"Wasn't that nice of God"

Somehow Psalm 73:26 came to me today.
"My flesh and my heart fail; but God is the strength
of my heart and my portion forever."

## My Best Friend

I have a lot of friends. Both of us do. We're blessed.
But I confess that I feel terribly alone without her.

My sister observed that I do have a lot of friends.
It's a blessing and I don't want to discount our friends.
I mentinoed the aloneness and she reminded me that it
makes sense: my BEST friend is gone.

To my friends: thank you for your support!
