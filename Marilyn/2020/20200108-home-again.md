# Home Again

I'm back at Omaha Court.

Made sure to leave Granger early enough so I'd have
plenty of daylight left when I got to Grove City.

## The Road

It was snowing in Granger when I left.
Scott made sandwiches for breakfast and lunch for travel.

Last time I took this route, I had her waiting when I got home.
Not today.

I had a couple of work phone calls
and a couple of podcasts to pass the time.

I stopped at Fellowship Baptist Church to drop off some paperwork.
Jim Stevanus was in his office and I spoke with him. Jessica had
heard the news and informed him and Jacquie.

## The House

Paul Geisler encouraged me to spend time in the house,
no TV, just be there. I'm going to have to live in this place.

I walked through the whole place. Picked up a couple of photos.
One photo in particular is of Marilyn and me at an office party.
Another is the collage Chelle put together.

Sunset reminds me of that couples retreat we went on
a couple times with the group from Cypress Bible Church.

## The Mail

Our neighbor Josh brought over mail and deliveries.
Kind of him and Christina to keep that for two weeks.
Several thoughtful cards from family and friends.

Looks like I'll have plenty to keep me busy for a while.

Trent Soles is starting a new men's group meeting at the library
and invited me to join them, so I went there. (Would have gone to
the main group at church otherwise.)
