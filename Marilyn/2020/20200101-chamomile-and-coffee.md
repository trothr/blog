# Chamomile and Coffee

After a long New Year's Day,
Martin and I are having chamomile tea.

## Chamomile

Martin is flying back to Virginia tomorrow.
We plan to meet-up with Granddaddy in the morning before his flight.

Chelle gave me a box of Celestial Seasonings Honey Vanilla Chamomile.
It's supposed to help with sleep. Seems to do so. This is what Martin
and I have been drinking before bed all week.

For the past several years, Marilyn switched from coffee to tea.
It's healthier. The Healthline web site has an article on chamomile.
The #3 point in that article is how chamomile "may protect against
certain types of cancer".

Healthier

She and Chelle would consistently do chamomile at night.
Marilyn had a different daily brew for the morning, usually making
a batch to last a couple days, less prep.

## Coffee

As a family, we're coffee snobs.
We've gone from common drip coffee makers to a number of better methods,
including French press. (THAT's good stuff, but kinda time consuming.)
Marilyn did the research.

The latest thing Martin and I use is a Hario brand pour-over.
For some people, this is even more time consuming than a French press.
For me, the only time sink is grinding the beans. (And they DO need
to be ground fresh.)

Here in Granger, Martin picked up some Starbucks "Holiday Blend" for
Keurig from Judy Allie (Bennett neighbor), which I also sampled
(it's quite good). I also picked up a burr grinder from Scott and Diane.

Chelle sticks to Starbucks (the store, not the Keurig cups)
for sake of saving time.

I hope everyone reading this has a great 2020.
