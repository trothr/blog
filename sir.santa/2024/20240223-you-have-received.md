# You have received a secure message

Somebody make it stop! <br/>
I get these, not often, but more often than I should.

They invariably lead me to some *other* service,
which kinda grates against the whole idea of email.

I got another today, so I got annoyed and decided to say something.

## You have received a secure message from ...

So there's some party that I do business with.
Maybe it's the insurance company. Maybe it's the doctor.
I appreciate that they want to keep our correspondence private.
Thank you! Sincerely. But you can do better.
You really *should* do better.

The trouble with most "secured" services is that they make you
jump through hoops to interact, even to converse. More frustrating
than the inconvenience\* is that the burden of multiple factors
is one sided: my financial advisor can send and receive secure email
to/from me, but it's built-in on his end. It's only *my* side
where I have to break out of whatever I normally do and go to his
special super-secure site.

\* I say "inconvenience" but it's more than just hassle.
It's a time sink, and it's potentially *less* secure because of
the complexity. (More things to get wrong.)

Maybe it was subconscious, that the in-house operation would be
integrated. Or maybe the IT department got push-back. I used to work
for a company that sold a secure email solution. (It is the premier
product in that space, top of the line, best of breed.) Even theirs
has trouble with "outsiders".

## Been There / Done That

How many times have we had to go *back* to some older method
when the newfangled turned out to be less effective?

Secure email has been available for more than three decades.
In fact, what we had "back in the day" was *better* (in terms of
actual *security*) than what we have now. Showing my hand,
I'm talking about PGP.

"Oh, but PGP is too hard." <br/>
Nonsense. Harder than the multi-step convoluted path to following
links to supposed secure sites? That's simply not a right assessment.

PGP is the most well-understood privacy tool on the planet.
It is well-integrated into several email client programs.
But ... you prefer a web interface? ... that can be done.
(Personally, I would not. But then, I keep my keys on my own keyring.
Others are comfortable handing off to a valet.) It's all about trust.

Some people just don't like it. Maybe it's the "not invented here"
syndrome. Or maybe they're low on the PGP learning curve. The thing
about facts is they kinda don't care what you like or dislike or
how you feel: facts remain. PGP is widely deployed, well established,
heavily used in certain circles, and has been throroughly analyzed.

<!--                                                                 -->

## Here's the Ask

To my insurers, medical providers, financial advisors,
and even my employers: take my public PGP key and use it.
Establish your own PGP key pair (or several, one per agent)
and send that to me. We can "vet" each other and ever afterward
carry on secure communication, and other interactions, without
you having to re-invent the wheel. Let security roll smoothly.

## More to Say

I'll keep this short,
so I'll skip all the reasons why secure email is better than
custom conversation code. I won't bother with how and why PGP
is better for privacy than PKI. We can talk about that.
I'd *like* to talk about all of that. But I don't expect
business or medical or (certainly not) governmental bodies
to have the background for that discussion.
