# The Truth about Electric Cars

Someone I follow on Twitter goes by the name Peter Sweden, real name
Peter Imanuelsen. Let's avoid the whole discourse about how Twitter
is a flawed platform. (But see "hype" below.) This guy's great,
a journalist who talks about issues from "the other side of the pond"
(from me). It's good to get a European perspective from someone who
actually lives there.

Sometimes what Peter posts is saddening. But he posted something
yesterday that surprised me. It was also disappointing: not just
that I disagree, but because it's a fact-lack perspective,
which I'm not accustomed to reading from him.

*Electric vehicles will never be real cars. \br
 A real car with a real engine has a mechanical feel to it.
 You can hear the engine roar and feel the machine working. \br
 It is a piece of art. \br
 An electric vehicle is just a monotone robot.*

## The Problems with Electric Drive

I'm a fan of electric drive, but I've seen a lot of headlines lately
that read something like, "the hidden problems with electric vehicles".
These stories go on to tell the unitiated about the supposedly lesser
known drawbacks to using electric locomotion. Some of them are pure
click-bait to draw your eyes to their advertising. There's nothing
in them that e-drive aficionados haven't already heard many times.

People, we live in a fallen world. Nothing's perfect.

Also, I have friends and family who make their living from,
or are heavily affected by, the petroleum industry. Being pro-electric
is not the same as being (cough, cough, California) anti-petroleum.

Let me go on record as saying that California's up-coming ban
on gasoline powered cars is a Bad Idea. In a similar vein, I'm also
a big fan of LED lighting, but the ban on incandescent bulbs is
just plain stupid: it assumes that the public are stupid en toto
and don't know when they should use LED versus CFL versus filament.

## Counter the Hype

I hate hype.

Like many (most?) new technologies, electric drive has been
promoted *hard* by the proponents, especially by those who have
invested (either business or personal effort or by purchase)
in electric vehicles. I get it! I'm there too. The tech is cool
and has many advantages over traditional (internal combustion)
automotive propulsion.

I'm a huge fan of electric and hybrid cars,
but they do not present us with a silver bullet.
E-drive is better than internal combustion. It's not the right solution
to every transportation problem.

## Just the Facts

Here are some advantages of electric drive:

* cooler in the summer
* no need for warm-up in the winter
* immediate full torque at zero revs
* quieter
* cleaner (literally *zero* tailpipe emissions)
* smoother (electric drive does not require shifting)
* more efficient (flatter performance curve)
* flexible fueling (because any other fuel can be turned into electricity)
* more reliable (consider an engine with *one* moving part)

Any one of these would be a strong selling point.
They're all true.

Here are some disadvantages of electric drive:

* range anxiety
* conversion loss

Also, it's easy to hide the remote sources of electric generation.
I was talking just last week with a colleague who observed, "So you
really burn coal.", and I conceded. Whether coal, hydro-electric,
wind, solar, nuclear, natural gas, or other, the power company
has to use something other than electricity to generate electricty.

But this is actually one of the *advantages* of e-drive: flexible fueling.

## To Grandmother's House We Go

The real problem most consumers have with electric cars is range anxiety.
The energy density of petroleum power is much higher than current
battery technology. It's not a problem if you *think* about what you're
doing, if you consider your treks. Hopping in the gas guzzler for the
quick trip to the convenience store is incredily wasteful for an
ordinary car. It also ages the vehicle (warm-up, cool-down).
Not so for electric. So for short trips, there is no argument.

But if Grandmother lives five states away, whether gas (or diesel)
or electric, you'll need to refuel.

Recently, I saw two of my cousins, a father and son, at family gathering.
They had each driven their Tesla from Atlanta to New Orleans.
That's a trip between 450 and 500 miles, beyond the range of even
the amazing Tesla. I don't know how, when, or where they recharged.
I DO know that they were both delighted with their experience.

## Cost and Control of Conversion

I visited my friend Tony at his apartment.
We were both freshmen in electrical engineering.
He lived across the tracks, yet close to them, and that evening
there was some clinking and clattering. I was curious, what the heck?

Tony: "They're tightening the coupling before they roll."

then he said: "You know that thing's electric?"

me: "No! Why take the conversion loss?" (going from diesel mechanical
to electrical and then back to mechanical)

Tony: "Would YOU wanna pop that clutch?"

Point taken!

It was still another 20 years before I understood that
electricity could power street vehicles. I thought electric "cars"
were limited to golf carts. But that's a whole other story.

There's a cost in the conversion, but the advantage is substantially
better *control* over the vehicle ... any vehicle: freight locomotive,
public transit (both bus and rail), even ships at sea. You might think
that lovely floating hotel you enjoyed on your cruise was pushed by
a pair of propellers at the ends of poles, but you'd be wrong.
Most large ships (for passengers or packages) are propeled by electric
motors which not only can be throttled up or down more precisely
but also can be turned in different directions in a pinch.

These are industries without idealism.
It's all about what works best in the big picture.

## "a mechanical feel to it"

I don't ride much, but once truly enjoyed motorcycling.
The bike I learned on was a 1972 Honda 350 Four, little brother to the
industry-changing CB750. And yeah, we're talking about gasoline power.
But I like it smooth. Four cylinders make it smooth.

Though I love buying American and treasure the legacy of Bill Harley
and the Davidson brothers, that well-known rough ride has no appeal.
The story goes (I state without proof or attribution) that the rough
ride is because of a design compromise made decades ago, and that
HD offered a smoother engine but the fans would not have it.

Makes me sad, but there's no accounting for taste.
(But let's call it what it is: preference, not practicality.)

Peter --
If you want a "mechanical feel", buy a Harley-Davidson.
