# Single Minded Brilliance

I heard Dave Cutler criticize Unix as not produced by one person, <br/>
implying that a group of PhDs had come up with a disjoint system.

Then I heard David Brailsford praise Unix as a "most amazing operating system" <br/>
which sprung from the mind of one man (Ken Thompson).

## Community Code

I'm a fan of Unix. <br/>
I'm content with its imperfections. <br/>
I'm delighted with its ubiquity and find it "sufficient".

It's no secret that Cutler hates Unix.
Even so, I'm a fan of him too. (The man is brilliant.)

Brailsford described Unix as created
"by computer scientists; for computer scientists".
That might sound self-serving, but it's not: the system fit the mindset
of programmers, allowing them to be more productive (or at least
more comfortable). Over time, most of the better designs sprang from
that platform.

Brailsford said Unix "did everything just right".
This was my experience too. And where there were gaps, they could
fill-in with applications from the community ... and did.

## Death Day Development

A notable systems programmer from my own past was asked how long
a particular project would take. He said "one death day". A death day
was essentially a 24-hour period. College students sometimes engage in
24-hour contests. (After age 25 years, I found that all-nighters got
more and more difficult.)

Whether a day, a week, a month ... a period of focus
can really wring-out the creative juices and grow the sweetest fruit.

Unix version zero was written, as Brian Kernigan tells the story,
in just three weeks. Thompson leveraged a DEC PDP 7, already obsolete
at that time, to investigate improved performance of filesystems.
Unix already existed (the name derived from MULTICS, but that's a story
for another time). His wife Bonnie was on a three week trip visiting family.
The system needed a handful of improvements: a shell, an editor, and an
assembler, each of which was done in one week. This matched his wife's trip.

The PDP 7 provided a whopping 8K words (about 16K bytes). <br/>
Eventually the group managed to acquire a DEC PDP 11, and the rest
is history.

## Bright Boys

Cutler is credited with creating Windows NT. <br/>
Before coming to Microsoft and leading the NT development, he was at DEC
and drove the VMS project. Prior to that, he headed up RSX-11 development.
There are few men who have such a resume.

If Cutler is the father of NT, Thompson is the father of Unix.
Dennis Ritchie was his partner in crime, but he leaned more into
development of C.

The point of this post is to highlight the consistency originally found
in Unix. The value of small teams led by smart people with a "system"
mindset cannot be overstated and is lost on most contemporary efforts.

And then came Linus Torvalds. <br/>
As of this writing, the wunderkind is 53, not a kid anymore.
The Linux kernel is another single-minded brainchild.

## Sunny Results

So today Cutler's code is king. Or is it?

The most widely deployed desktop/laptop systems run MS Windows,
that being derivatives of NT. But alternatives exist with their own
enthusiastic fan bases. Mac OS (call it "OS X") is really Apple Darwin,
a Unix variant. It's surprising to see the number of software engineers
who insist on Mac OS as their primary worksystem. Some of us prefer Linux,
this author being one. Some prefer BSD (especially FreeBSD), a Unix
system with roots at UC Berkeley.

Linux owes its whole existence to Unix.
Linus wrote the kernel and maintains firm control over its source,
not with thousands of contributors. That finely cut gem is the heart
of most computer systems on the planet, including your Android phone.

Unix implementations abound. DEC VMS sported a POSIX side.
The stereotypical green screen mainframe, lately called z/OS,
has a Unix interface, which IBM leans on more and more.
Then there are services like MINGW and CYGWIN, providing a Unix
environment for MS Windows. Windows itself now emulates true Linux,
and pretty well. (WSL1 is an under-valued development.)

Let's raise a glass to Thompson and Ritchie and Kernighan and others
who focused on polishing individual cogs of code for the greater good.

About an hour and five minutes into this last one, Cutler blames
the universities for Unix disparity, and he's right. But the inclusion
of universities was a major driving factor supporting the Unix community.

And, no, not everything is a file. <br/>
And object oriented is similarly not a be-all end-all.
