# Brian Sings

My dear friend, a Brother in Christ,
an inspiration and supporter and counselor,
Brian has gone home.

He "graduated" last night.

## The Early Service

Susan and I opted for the early service at First Baptist this morning.
Weather was threatening. Big Berna made his rounds greeting congregants
and soon got to us. "This is my wife Susan." He knew our story
and shared his joy and that he's praying for us.

I'm part of the Band of Brothers men's group. David was obliged to
let me know:

"Brian Kinnett passed away last night."

I thanked him for telling me. Susan held me more tightly.
She and I had been praying for Brian and Ronda for weeks.

## How Can I Sing?

We were about to start the worship time. We were supposed to be singing.
But how can I sing?

Trent was leading worship. How can *he* sing?

Even the night before, as we had dinner with Trent and Michele, how can
we be having fun when our brother is in decline and in so much pain?

I knew I needed to praise the Lord.
I'd been through this before, and worse:
When Marilyn "graduated", we worshiped. I don't know how, but we did.

I started to sing as best I could.

## Brian Sings

Couldn't hear Trent.
I wondered if he was actually singing.
(Others on stage might simply be stronger.)

And then it hit me.
The Lord reminded me: Brian is singing!
He's in the presence of Jesus, with no pain and no tears.

If Brian can sing, then I can too!
I prayed for Trent, then txted him also.

Pastor Dave struggled to finish his sermon. At the end, he mentioned
Brian's faith and legacy. The sermon was on Colossians 1:19-29.
The second half of verse 27 is a life verse for Brian.

Pastor Jerry struggled to get through the announcements.

After the service we saw Trent and Jerry and Dave.
I told them what the Lord reminded me of: Brian is in Glory.
