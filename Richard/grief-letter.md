# A Grief Letter

I've been told that I should write a "grief letter".

In Grief Share, they recommend we write a letter to friends and family
explaining a little about where we're at, what they can do to help,
what to expect from us.

I heard from old coworkers in Texas. One had heard about Marilyn
and told the other. Both were unsure of how to engage with me
in conversation. This letter is intended to help with that.

## What Happened

In October of 2019, Marilyn started having some acute abdominal pain.
We concluded that it was probably her gallbladder. (Which at the time
was a relief, not being her appendix.) She contacted her primary care
doctor, in the Ohio State medical system. He put her in touch with a
surgeon who specialized in gallbladder and related things.

On Wednesday, November 6th, we saw the surgeon and planned next steps.
The clinic drew blood for tests. On Thursday, November 7th, the doctor
called to say that Marilyn's white blood cell count was very high.
"Go to the ER. Have them call my office." So we did exactly that.
While in ER, they performed a broader abdominal scan and saw a mass
on her pancreas and spots on her liver.

Biopsy and analysis took time, but the implication was clear.
We saw Chelle and Martin that weekend and let them know Mom had cancer.
It hurt.

After one week in a private room, Marilyn started having breathing trouble.
They moved her to the ICU, which initially helped. She could have returned
to the private room, but rooms were not available. Then, too soon, she
needed additional critical care (but was already in ICU).

We thought we would be pursuing chemotherapy. Acute issues kept her
in ICU, so chemo never happened. Her liver had been hit hard already
and started to fail. It hampered her kidneys which led to renal failure.
After five weeks and two days, she was gone.

There's more to the story.
You're welcome to ask, but I'll keep it short in this note.

## What Now?

We held two services, one in Ohio and one in Texas.
The memorials were beautiful. It was really comforting to see so many
loved ones.

The loss is excruciating.
I find that writing this grief letter gives me a "flashback".
It doesn't hurt to tell people what happened, but oddly it does hurt
a little to write this. That's just one of countless weird things.

I've had lots of help from more than three dozen close family and friends.
I'm trying to get on my feet enough that I can lean a little less.
But I learned several years ago to accept help, so I do.

Marilyn was my partner in every way.
It feels like my right arm has been ripped away.

The loneliness is the worst of it.

At first, I was very angry. At one point, I yelled at two of the
people most close to me. I seem now to be well past the rage stage.
(So please don't fear that I'll yell at you if you call or visit.)

Lately I'm just sad. But the sadness is not constant.

I've also been getting help for other life issues that were
building up for months, even years, before Marilyn got sick.
So I've been learning a lot, but the question is still open:
"what next?". This is where I have to just wait on the Lord.

My world seems to have gotten very small.
God will have to enlarge things. I'm looking for His plan.

## What You Can Do

Pray for me.
So many times I've called out to God and He has provided,
even when Marilyn was in the hospital. So please pray that God will
do what needs to be done, that He will provide. Pray that He will
give me a mission and that He will make me whole.

Pray for Chelle and Martin.
They're just starting their adult lives. Moving forward without Mom
has been really difficult.

All three of us are in shock, even nearly four months after the fact.

You're welcome to ask me any question, and please ask!

You're welcome to call or email or txt. It helps more than you know.
I've been told that sometimes people avoid those who have experienced
loss because they don't know what to say. Please don't be uncomfortable
around me (around us). Feel free to call!

Everybody's got ideas about how I should get through this. You're welcome
to share your thoughts. I might not be able to do exactly what you say,
but I still appreciate your input. Please understand that I can't do
everything everyone suggests.

If you think I'm doing something wrong, it's alright to say so.
(Proverbs 27:5, "Open rebuke is better than love carefully concealed.")

It's ironic that the global quarantine hit us as I started this journey.
Others are suffering *far worse* than I am. I have 33 years of great
memories. Many don't. I still have a comfortable house and a great job.
Countless thousands ... even millions ... don't. To the extent that I
can help someone else, it gets my eyes off of my own pain. Praise God!

So if I can help YOU with something, please ask! It will help me!
You cannot imagine what a blessing it is to have something to do
that means something to someone other than myself.

## What Next

As of this writing, I'm not moving, nor selling the house.
I do have a boatload of things to do, lots of junk to get rid of.
Marilyn wanted to get rid of the excess anyway. Somewhere there's
a notepad with a short list of grand projects. Marilyn, being the
organized one, wrote down our goals and ideas for this house.
Some of those projects *must* happen.

I had been involved in the men's group at First Baptist Grove City.
That involvement has deepened. Prior to the Coronavirus lock-down,
I was attending the Genesis service at FBC. Now everything is online.

I've been attending Grief Share. That has helped, more than expected.
Some of the GS people have become friends to me.

Spiritual war happens.
Some of you reading this might not understand, and others might not
believe it, but the single biggest need is some sort of spiritual
defense. I am very vulnerable. Chelle and Martin are vulnerable too.

Praise God for opportunities to help others!
But there too, disruptions (natural) and attacks (supernatural)
are a real problem. Some days are good. Some days are not so good.

I pray a lot. (I was praying a lot before Marilyn got sick.)

Long term, I want to know Christ.
Long term, I want to build into others.
How long will I be here on earth? Who can partner with me? I need help.
