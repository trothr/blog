# Susan and me

Monday afternoon I spoke with Jo Ann.
We had several things to talk about, and then she asked about
the golf outing. Scott and Diane had come down for the weekend.
That led to discussing the whole "siblings weekend" Susan and I had.
I explained that, no, it was not all men; it was a mixed group.
I explained that Susan's sister and brother-in-law had come up,
and her brother and sister-in-law had come up, so then Diane and Scott
had come down.

Jo Ann pressed me: who is Susan? "Are you interested in her?".
Well, of course! And I told her a little about how we met. But again,
"Are you interested in her?". Well, yeah, we've been going out.
A third time, "Are you interested in her?". Yes! (It would seem
obvious by now.)

She was gracious: "I don't like it, but I understand.".

## Double Therapy

When Grief Share at my own church was not yet starting,
I looked around for another "safe" GS group. Cedarville, sure.
Close enough and likely to be "safe". I've always been fond of the
university, so I contacted the leader of that group. She said they were
also not yet starting because she had been in the hospital. I asked how
I could pray for her: double pneumonia, sepsis, and abscessed lung.
Wow, "I'll pray for you.".

When both groups started, I was still curious about the Cedarville
group, so I went. The leader welcomed me. I asked if it was okay
that I was in another group, "Oh sure; whatever you need.".
I suspected that she was from Texas (area code 281 phone number)
and she was as welcoming as a Texan. I wound up bonding with the
whole group. Initially, the anonymity helped, but as we shared
our stories, anonymity was replaced by common cause and caring.

## Texas Connection

What happened to be the last in-person meeting of the Cedarville group
we happened to be talking about Texas. Susan did not realize that I am
also a Texan. She and Jim were talking about it, and I said that I too
am from Texas. In fact, my dad went to Dallas Seminary. Turns out that
Susan's late husband went to Southwesstern. (friendly competition)
Later, something was said about Aggies, so I flashed my A&M ring.

Turns out that Ronney had charged Todd in Houston (another Aggie)
with watching over Susan should anything happen to him. So even though
Ronney was all about Longhorns, the Ags have a special place with Susan.

## Spaghetti Companionship

We became friends. Coronavirus hit, and the group had to meet online.
Tom and I helped get the tech arranged. I was already using online
meeting services heavily as part of my job. Susan turned to me
for help with that, so we wound up conversing often.

I forget who started it, but Susan and I began sharing what we had
read in God's Word. As part of coping with my grief, I leaned hard
into reading the Bible. Eventually the Scripture had an effect on me.
Jim Stevanus (counselor) took me through Ephesians until I was
saturated in it. God's Word itself became a major factor in my
recovery. To share what I'd learned with Susan, and to hear what she
had also learned, was like water to a thirsty soul.

I appreciate her perspective. When I said something about my
new friends, and one being female, Chelle didn't get it. But the way
women think is fundamentally different from how men think. Susan said
women's brains are like spaghetti and men's brains are like waffles:
women are all interconnected but men are compartmentalized.

## Fresh Air

As the year progressed, the Lord began fixing my broken parts.
One thing I had lost (and this was even before Marilyn got sick,
but so much worse after she left) was my love of music. That returned.
I have 100 vinyl albums that I really want to "rip" to digital.
I mentioned this to the GS group. Susan said that she had a turntable
and offered to let me use it. I took her up on the offer.

While waiting for the sounds (including pops and crackles, for those
who remember "records") to get transferred into the computer,
Susan and I talked. How open could I be? "Oh, I don't mind talking
about Marilyn. I want to know everything about her.". What? Really?
It was such a release, so freeing to be able to talk about my loss
and the life that I knew.

To be fair, this would have to be a two-way street. I wondered if I
would have liked Ronney. As I found out what kind of preacher he was,
how he stepped out of the pulpit to reach people, even to the chagrin
of deacons who just wanted to fill pews, my heart grew to love him.

## Telling Everyone

By now, I've told everyone that I can think of about Susan.

For her part, Susan has done the same.

Everyone has been so supportive, many with great enthusiasm.
But some are hurting, of course. Susan and I have been healed
from our loss. Pray for those friends and family who have not.

This journal entry is just a tiny part of our story.
There's so much more to say. May God allow the time
and provide the words. May our life reflect His love and provision.
