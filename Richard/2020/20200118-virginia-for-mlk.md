# Virginia for MLK

I'm in Virginia this morning.
Missed two days of journaling.

There was some good that happened,
and I shared that via email with "the mosh pit".

It's a long weekend.
Monday is Martin Luther King Day.

## Pendulum

Yesterday was another "difficult day".
I blew 16 hours in near constant rage.

It's almost as if the pendulum swung back from the prior good day
only to fly further in the "bad" direction".


## Fuming is Venting

I was fuming at God.
He took my wife away.
He took my son's mother away.
"IT'S CRUEL!!!!!".

Tom has encouraged me to talk to my bride. He talks to Helene.
Well ... I talked to her yesterday alright: I yelled at her,
"WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME?!?!?". (Happy now Tom?)

Later, when I was on the rode, Dave Wange called.
He again encouraged me that the anger is actually normal.

## Calm in the Morning

This morning, I reflected on crying out to God.
(Not griping at Him. I mean the humble, "PLEASE HELP!".)

I realized that, in this saga, when I have cried for Help,
He *has* responded. Every time!

So what was I upset about yesterday? What am I angry about this morning?

The pain.
He has not taken the *pain* away.

## Psalm 18

Today I'm reading Psalm 18.
I fear that I will fail on verse 21.

I DO BELIEVE. Specifically here, I believe verse 30.

Psalm 18 is a psalm of war. (David was a man of war.)
Throughout Psalm 18, the Lord rescues David from those who hate him.
Who hates me? THAT is from whom I need defense. That is the one
who whispers angry reminders in my ear. God save me from that one.

*The pangs of death surronded me, and the floods of ungodliness
made me afraid. The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death
confronted me. In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried out
to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him,
even to His ears.*

Dear Lord, please hear my cry. Please heal me and Martin and Michelle.
Please comfort us now and give us hope for the future.
