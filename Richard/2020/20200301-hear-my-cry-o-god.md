# Hear My Cry O God

Psalm 61

"Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I will cry to You,
when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock
that is higher than I."

## When God Helps

When I call out to the Lord for help, He helps.

I can't count the times I've cried out and then He prompted
someone to call, send email, send a txt message, or come over.

But the help comes from Him.

Just now, Sunday morning, I'm going to miss church.
That thought overwhelmed me. Several things happening
preventing me from attending, so I'll miss the worship music,
miss the sermon (which I realy need today), and especially miss
seeing the people. Oh Lord, please help!

Nobody called. Got no email. But He calmed my heart.
Thank you, Lord!

## The Storm

No doubt much of this storm is just emotion.

What about when it's not? What about when it's something else?
What about when it's a *spiritual* thing, supernatural attack?
And how can I tell the difference?

Skipping church may be the single worst thing I've done in life.
It's not some ritual. (Though ritual helps people like me who so
desperately need structure.) And it's not as if occasional interruptions
are harmful. But I've allowed it too often, resulting in lost fellowship.

The solitude continues to weigh on me.

Dear God redeem the time I've wasted.

And then as I'm about to post this, I got email from Brian.
Thank you Lord!

## Psalm 61

Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed;
lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

For You have been a shelter for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
I will abide in Your tabernacle forever;
I will trust in the shelter of Your wings.

For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given me the heritage
of those who fear Your name.
You will prolong the king's life, his years as many generations.
He shall abide before God forever.
Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him!

So I will sing praise to Your name forever, that I may daily perform my vows.

## Psalm 62 tomorrow

This year, I've been reading the Psalms.
Today is the 61st day of the year. Tomorrow is the 62nd,
so before closing I noticed the first paragraph of Psalm 62:

"Truly my soul silently waits for God; from Him comes my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense;
I shall not be greatly moved."
