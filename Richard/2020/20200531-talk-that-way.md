# God Doesn't Talk That Way

We gotz to listen to God's voice.

*"Too many voices. Too many noises. Too many choices."* --

## Lust for Technology

Summer of 2005, we bought a Prius.
Took a while to find one witout "paint sealer" and other
doubtful dealer details. Finally found one up in Conroe.

Marilyn had a fender bender with the neighbor resulting in the Suburban
("her" vehicle) being in the shop for several days. She had to drive
the aging Tempo ("my" vehicle). Now ... two things about this Tempo:
First, it was the lemon of a pair of Tempos we had at one point.
But also, and this is my fault, it was in decline as we put more
time and money into maintaining the Suburban.

"You need a new car.".
Okie, dokie, thank ye, honey.
(Now how to pay for it? That's another story.)

The kids chimed in, "Let's go look at one of those hybrids
you're so gah-gah about.". My family knows me too well.

We needed a new car. The logical choice came down to one of Honda Accord,
Toyota Camry (which I drive now, ironcally, *and* which is now paid off,
praise God!), or the Toyota Prius. That year, the Prius still had a premium.
I wanted the Prius. I was willing to get the Camry or Accord, and would
have been happy with either of those as a great second choice.
In the end, the Prius won fair and square.

The Prius is a smaller car, so I sat in the back with the front seat
slid fully back to be sure my son would fit in this vehicle when he
grew older. (Didn't count on him being 6'4", but he still fit
in the front by then.)

The dealer wanted $24167 or some such odd number.
I had a check for $24000. Told them that was my hard limit.
"No problem." The additional $167 magically went away.
(And how sales guys can do that is magic that eludes me to this day.)

Here's the rub: guilt.
The problem with false guilt is that it feels JUST THE SAME
as real guilt. I really wanted this car. I was geeked about the tech.

Driving home, this voice came to me, with clenched teeth,

*You bought this car because of your lust for technology!*

Next moment, I realized, that's not God. He doesn't talk that way.

And then I had peace.

A couple weeks later, Marilyn says to me in this sweet voice,
"Honey, I like your new car.". Ahhhh.... yes!

We all came to love that car.
By the time the kids could drive, it was in demand for any excursion.

This thing about "that's not how God talks" has really stuck with me.
I don't have Scripture for it, but it seems clear. God convicts us,
but he doesn't lay false guilt on us. False guilt comes from elsewhere.

## Know How It Feels

Mom died.
She "graduated" in October of 2015.
We all miss her, though by now most of us are okay, over the
initial shock, past the loss and loving the legacy. And what a legacy!

Dad was hit hard.
The loneliness was profound, more than I could understand.
He needed to find someone. He needed companionship.
(We're all made for community, even though not all of us marry.)
He quickly found Carolyn.

Knowing Carolyn will take time. I'm committed to it!
She's a dear woman with her own loving legacy, three sons,
and now three husbands. But we were not supportive. The four of us
just weren't ready for my dad's new reality.

I did not empathize.
I'm usually *very* empathetic, but not always with some people.
Dunno why I have so little empathy for my dad. (Bothers me.)

Then Marilyn.
She "graduated" this past December.
Now it's my turn, and the loneliness is profound.

On reflection, I don't think I fully grieved for Mom until Marilyn was
also taken from me. But that's another story. Anyway, it hurt ... bad.

Earlier this year, this voice came to me, no clenched teeth,
but dripping sarcasm,

*Now you know how it feels!*

It took a while, but then I realized, that's not God.
He doesn't talk that way. God also doesn't throw things at us just to
"pay us back" for having been hard on someone else. He doesn't force us
into some sort of coerced empathy or faux sympathy.

It took a while, but I came to see that the Lord did not take Marilyn
from me to force me to empathize more with Dad. In fact, He didn't
"take Marilyn" to punish me in any way at all. He took her because
our days are in His hands.

There's been a lot of pain.
After the pain, there is healing, and then there are even new blessings.
I'm learning how to breath again. Praise God!
But death is not part of life. Death is the end result of a
corrupted nature, which in turn is because of our Edenic disobedience.

I should probably have a blog post about that:
DEATH IS NOT "JUST PART OF LIFE". Death is not part of God's creation.
Next time you hear someone say, "death is just part of life", take them
to task for that comment! Maybe they think that's helpful? IT'S NOT.
And I'll be glad to share (verbally) "how it feels".

The enemy twists truth.
YES, I now know experientially how Dad felt.
That's true. But that's *not God's purpose*.
Whatever His purpose is goes beyond reprisal.
God's plan moves past vengeance and doesn't stop until Glory.

## Listen

How do we learn God's voice?

It's been said that bankers give tellers real money, lots of it, to
handle, feel, touch, hold, so that they'll come to know the real thing.
When they finally encounter a counterfeit, they just know because they
"just know" the real thing. This is surely true in other industries.
The "knowing" only comes with time and experience.

For a short while, I taught high school Sunday school. I told the kids,
about the Bible, "Just read it.". But not everyone can "just read"
anything. I know that. I love those kids. Best thing I could impart
was for them to actually spend personal time in God's Word.
I so deeply hope they do, even if they don't "just read" stuff.

As I write this, I realize that I've spent *a lot* of time in God's Word
this year. Maybe I'm starting to recognize His Voice? Hope so. Tell you
what, though, dear reader: you'd do well to seek out that Voice.
Get into the Word! Read it. Read it often. Read more than just
the snippets you get in your favorite devotional. Read the Book.
Learn the Voice.

*"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish,
neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand."* -- John 10:27,28
