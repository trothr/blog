# Glimmer of Hope

Hope and heartache. Got a little hope but still lots of heartache.

How long will friends and family put up with my ramblings?

## Signs of Hope

Friday, after meeting with the counselor,
there was a ray of hope, the light at the end of the tunnel.
It only lasted a moment. More on that below.

I have to call out daily, even hourly, sometimes even more often.
When I call out, when I cry for help, God provides.

"Cry for Help". That's a song. Something by Out of the Grey.
I do miss the music.

## Clouds and Rain

It's raining again today.
Sunny skies once or twice over the past few days.
Not today.

Marilyn loved the weather.
I miss watching it with her.
If only the "storms of life" could be simply watchable.
Sadly that's not a spectator sport.

The rain is peaceful, even pleasant. The clouds I could do without.

## Escape from the Solitude

Gotta get out of the house!

I love this house.
I love what we planned, designed, and lived in.
But it's become an empty shell. The memories are killing me.
Even before Marilyn got sick, the house had become a burden to her.
Now it's a burden to me, an albatross.

Mom will never visit here again. Dad probably won't either.

Gene will never visit here again. Jo Ann will almost certainly
not either.

Chelle doesn't live here anymore.

Martin doesn't live here anymore.

Marilyn doesn't live here anymore. Why am I here?

So ... get out!
I was at Starbucks for over four hours. It helped.
The staff are starting to recognize me.

Get out.
I've also gone to the library. Was there on Saturday
while Martin was busy with a friend. It helped.
But the library brings its own "memories".

I put away some wash cloths. More in the drawer. Our colors,
Marilyn picked out. Had to remind myself, "They're just towels.".

Have to remind myself, "It's just a house.".

## Persistent Pain versus Possible Progress

Grief Share last night didn't help.
GS usually helps, but last night a major theme was "pain heals".
Seriously?!? Yes, that's what they're saying: the pain leads to healing.

I want to get through this. I want to arrive at the joy.
But I don't know how much more *pain* I can take.
I'm not trying to rush. I'm just trying to come up for air.

Tonight the story was different. (GS group in Cedarville)
Same DVD, but I noticed ... they said that the intentional steps
we take in grief also lead to healing. Oh thank God.

## No Home

I'm close to living in the car.
I say "the" car rather than "my" car because Marilyn
picked out this car. Ironic that she had such a major influence
in getting rid of the older vehicles and getting us (now "mw")
a decent ride. This Camry is probably the nicest car we ever owned.

It's almost like I have no home.
I'm trying to get out daily.
I pack the laptops, gather loose papers, head to Starbucks, anywhere.

Tomorrow morning I'm supposed to work out at Orange Theory.
THAT is a good workout! Would go walking today but for the rain.
Exercise helps. Always. Going to the gym means I'm around people.
Not people that I know, but at least other humans.

Humans ... people

I'm still using the ham radio as a source for human voices.

I crave txt messages on the phone, even Kabby's colorful pablum.

## Working Hard

Work doesn't help.
My job is "data protection", keeping computer info safe from attackers.
The job is great, but part of what I do is keep abreast of privacy
and related issues. The news is depressing.

My productivity is down, but I'm *tryng* to get things done.
Sometimes I think management and teammates are avoiding me,
or are avoiding tossing work my way because of "Rick's situation".

Then too, some of the most important (to me) stuff that I've done
gets rejected by others (not my team, but other people in my division).
The rejection compounds the grief. Turns out *everyone's* grief
is compounded. Life is hard.

## Don't Waste It

"Don't waste your cancer"

So we found out it wasn't just gallbladder. It was cancer.
Someone forwarded to me some wise writings of several Christian leaders.
One said, "Don't waste your cancer.", meaning: take advantage of this
horrible thing to give glory to God, to learn, to reach people.
Okay, fine, will do.

Don't waste your grief

I guess "don't waste it" should apply to the grief too.
I'm trying to move through this, trying to make use of the situation.
I have an opportunity to get close to God. Fewer distractions.
Supposedly.

But I don't know how much more I can take!

When I cry, when I weep, the sound of my own voice is frightening.

## A Glimmer of Hope

After meeting with Pastor Jim on Friday,
for just a moment there was a sense of hope about the future,
the plan, the purpose, the assignment. For that moment,
the grief was just grief, not compounded by being adrift.

I really think God's holding back until He's ready. For what?
Dunno. Meanwhile, I'm trying to not waste the grief.

Reminds me of that camping trip years ago. I was with Matt
and Mark. Life had no meaning for me in those days. It's similar now.
Some days I just don't want to do anything.

God is with me, but humanly I'm alone, desolate.

Dear God, please help!

And then He does. Really. It's amazing.
