I was in Cataloochee on Tuesday.

What is Cataloochee? It's a ski area a couple hours east of Oak Ridge.

## Knoxville First

My teammate Will Pearson lives in Knoxville.
I contacted him, said I'd be in the area, asked if we could meet up.
He lives fairly close to downtown, so we met in Market Square.

What a great place! Will didn't use the term "urban renewal",
but said much of the development is new. (Same idea in my book.)
We found his favorite coffee shop, Old City Java, not far from the square.
He pointed out Good Golly Tamale across the street. Lots of trendy
shops on the square.

Will and I got on-board Voltage Security about the same time,
but he's been on the sales side longer than I have.
Good visit, though brief. Then I headed over to Oak Ridge.

## Skiing with Scott

Several weeks ago, Scott invited me to join him and other men
from his church for a one-day skiing trip. Scott's in Oak Ridge
and the ski area is over in North Carolina. Skiing ... cool!
On a TUESDAY? Heck yeah: way less crowded on a weekday.

So actually, I was in Maggie Valley, North Carolina.
The ski area is called Cataloochee after the Cataloochee Valley.

The group turned out to be Scott and Tom and myself plus two of
Scott's pastors, Jeremy and Joe. We gathered at Oak Ridge Baptist.
Jeremy drove the church van.

When we got there, we met Dave, another church member. At least
three others had originally planned to join us, but stuff happens.
It was a teriffic outing. Fun time without being an overload.
(Tom did not actually ski but simply enjoyed the fellowship
and a bit of needed downtime.)

## 24 Hours of Peace

I'm telling the story a little out of order.
The sequence of events was that I drove down from Ohio on Monday,
met Will in Knoxville, then went to Oak Ridge to Scott's place.
Tom was already there at Schwahn Manor when I arrived.
Jill was there because she'd been off from work that day.
And Scott got back from the store not too long after I got there.
Their home is so welcoming and their hearts were so open.

We had a wonderful dinner together but did not stay up late and left
the house around 5AM the next morning. Then our skiing adveture.
Then back to Scott and Jill's for another awesome dinner.

There was enough time for Tom and me to get in some reading.
I finished "A Grief Observed".

Let me say that again, I finished "A Grief Observed" by C. S. Lewis.
It's not long book. Lewis is not hard to read. But the subject was
tough for me to get into.

The observation Lewis makes is a lot like what I too observe:
memories of the lost beloved incroaching on the reality of that person.
Swirling emotions, but not a circle. Maybe a spiral? Is it up or down?
God seems to be a Cosmic Sadist to have allowed this devastation
on someone He supposedly loves.

But for more than 24 hours, I was not overwhelmed. I could think about
Marilyn, remember her, talk about her, even read the Lewis book.
So I was able to finish the little thing.

While I was there, Glenn called too.
So good to hear from him. So good to talk, and he understands.
I am so blessed to have such support from friends.

## Wider Swing?

I almost named this post "wider swing".
Had such a great time with Scott's people, best in weeks.
Then came home to fall seemingly lower than before,
as if the good time had to be balanced by an equally bad time.

Maybe I should just cut-back on the travel. As I drove down Monday,
it was definitely a better drive than when I went to Virginia.
It was still very emotional.

The drive back to Ohio from Tennessee initially went okay.
Emotions swirl. A wrong turn is frustrating, and frustration
gets amplified. But at least I have a trajectory: follow the map.
I also have podcasts. Helps to hear other human voices.

Why is it so excruciating?
What is wrong with me? Why can't I accept my new life and move forward?
I think I'm slowly learning a few things.

Wednesday,
I drove directly to Fellowship Baptist, wrapped-up my homework,
went inside and met with Jim. He had said that things should start to
click for me this week. But then he assigned Ephesians 1, 2, and 3 AGAIN.

"What am I not seeing?"

If Marilyn was with us, she would very likely say that I'm being stubborn,
that I'm fighting, refusing to see what's right in front of me.
Okay, so Eph 1/2/3 again.

## Home Again

Left Fellowship Baptist.
Thankfully hit the loop before heavy rush hour.
Rounded the corner. Heard some static on the ham radio.
In a weird way, that was an accomplishment. But the house is empty.

Somber, but okay.
Until I saw Marilyn's wedding portrait.
At that point, I broke down, cried, just cried and cried.

Jim had pointed out from Ephesians that I am NOT alone.
But I AM alone. Clearly God is with me. I'm not alone, but LONELY.
I don't like that word. Makes me so ashamed.

Angry again: slamming doors, wishing I might do it hard enough
to make a picture fall from the wall. One does, and then I feel bad.
Arguing with God, and He answers back, and beats my arguments!
"Why do I even bother? You're right! You'll win!". (For clarity, we're
not talking about voices in my head or audible speech. We're talking
about that thought which pops in, the answer to the question you just
asked or the rebuttal to the argument you just made.)

## Psalm 30

"I will extole You, O Lord, ..."

I used to extol the Lord.
I miss the praise that I used to be able to utter.

Verse 2, "O Lord my God, I cried out to You and You healed me.".
PLEASE PLEASE, I'm BEGGING, HEAL ME.

First part of verse 11, "You turned for me my mourning into dancing".
When will I see that?

Today (Thursday) I had lunch with Brian.
Thank God (again!) for supporting friends.

After a lackluster day of trying to get work done, I went to Starbucks
to get out of the house. Having finished "A Grief Observed", I cracked
open "Dark Clouds, Deep Mercy". This one's even scarier (more pages
for one thing). He talks about LAMENT as a thing to DO, as if one could
WANT to express lament. But I read it anyway.

Well ... there was a break in the storm for a brief 24 hours.
