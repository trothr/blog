# Reminders

Somehow today I'm hit by reminders.

## Reminders in Town

I had a local tech meeting first thing this morning.
Drove near where we went for Sapphire (our particular home schooling
"enrichment program"). 
past places that we went as a family or that Marilyn had taken
the kids.

Got to the meeting. First local technical "meetup" that I've attended
in several months. Left early for a second appointment. As I was leaving,
something triggered a memory of when we first came to Ohio.

Marilyn helped me get established. We were a team.
I depended on her. (And now without her I'm floundering ... so much to do!
Little idea HOW to proceed.) I drove up from Houston. She flew.
We met in Columbus. I picked her up at CMH (now John Glenn airport).

For a moment, just an instant, it was a happy memory!
But then the sense of loss overwhelmed me.

I cried like a baby. Pulled out of the parking lot still in tears
so that I wouldn't run late to the next meeting (with the counselor).

I have no idea what triggered this.

Difficult to work.
Starting to worry that I might need to go on disability.
Getting out of the house helps fend off the emotion, but it takes
a lot of coordination (having to pack-up what I might need when I go
to Starbucks or the library or some such place).

## Reminders at Home

Lots of memories at home.
Sometimes they don't lead to sadness, but most are bittersweet.

In the bedroom:

* a green-and-white striped bag, used for the beach,
also used while Marilyn was in the hospital

* a yellow bag, smaller, with lotions

* a Texas Scents brand mood candle, "Brush Fire" scent

* clothes

In the bathroom:

* hairclips (which I had washed when she was out of town, 
then placed back where they were left)

* a hairband she used for keeping her hair out of her face
when washing

* her whole side of the double sink

* a letter from our daughter when she first moved to Virginia

* her toothbrush

In the den:

* shoes by the stairs, ready for going outside, gloves too

* an escape ladder (second floor, fire safety) which the Security Queen ordered years ago

* a picture of her and me when we were dating, pictures of us with the kids in DC, another wearing "Santa caps"

* her Buckeye necklace

* the "have you seen this person?" photo on the fridge

* her sunglasses

Pray for me.

Dear God, You are the only One who can heal this hurt.
Please fill the void.
