# Reminders

Somehow today I'm hit by reminders.

## Reminders in Town

I had a local tech meeting first thing this morning.
Drove near the place we went for Sapphire (our particular home schooling
"enrichment program"). Marilyn was *so* in her element at Sapphire.
I taught a couple classes too. It was a happy time: I for one felt
a sense of purpose and community in those days.

That was 2010. Now it's 2020.

Got to the meeting, a security thing. First local technical "meetup"
that I've attended in several months. Left early for a second appointment.
As I was leaving, something triggered a memory of when we first came to Ohio.

Marilyn helped me get established. We were a team.
I depended on her. (And now without her I'm floundering ... so much to do!
Little idea HOW to proceed.) December of 2005 I drove up from Houston.
She flew. We met in Columbus. I picked her up at CMH (now John Glenn airport).

For a moment, just an instant, it was a happy memory!
But then the sense of loss overwhelmed me.

I cried like a baby. Pulled out of the parking lot still in tears
so that I wouldn't run late to the next meeting (with the counselor).

I have no idea what triggered this.

Difficult to work.
Starting to worry that I might need to go on disability.
Getting out of the house helps fend off the emotion, but it takes
a lot of coordination (having to pack-up what I might need when I go
to Starbucks or the library or some such place).

## Reminders at Home

Lots of memories at home.
Sometimes they don't lead to sadness, but most are bittersweet.

In the bedroom:

* a green-and-white striped bag, used for the beach,
also used while Marilyn was in the hospital

* a yellow bag, smaller, with lotions

* a Texas Scents brand mood candle, "Brush Fire" scent

* clothes

In the bathroom:

* hairclips (which I had rinsed off from the dust while she was in Texas
last year and then placed back where she had left them)

* a hairband she used for keeping her hair out of her face
when washing

* her whole side of the double sink

* a letter from our daughter when she first moved to Virginia

* her toothbrush

In the den:

* shoes by the stairs, ready for going outside, gloves too

* an escape ladder (second floor, fire safety) which the Security Queen ordered years ago

* a picture of her and me when we were dating, pictures of us
with the kids in DC, another of the four of us wearing "Santa caps"

* her Buckeye necklace

* the "have you seen this person?" photo on the fridge

* her sunglasses

## Hoping for Healing

I met with Jim Stevanus again today. We went over Ephesians 1-3 again.
I need to get my affirmation, my value, my importance from Christ.
Men tend to derive their significance from achievements.

I keep bumping into the *circumstance* every time I turn around.
It does not help to know there are other families feeling similar loss.
I wind up going empathetic and hurting for the other people too.

I'm choosing to look toward God.

I did walk today. Cold, but managed to get out while still had sun.
Need sunshine. Probably should get a vitamin D supplement. Jeff and Trent
came over for our Wednesday men's group. We read Psalm 20:1-5.

Pray for me. I'm still in shock. I'm frightened.

Dear God, You are the only One who can heal this hurt.
Please fill the void. Please hold me in Your hand.
