# Counseling and Kroger

Friday ... counseling, meetings, reviewing, shopping, sleep.

Diane suggested that I run up to Granger for the day.
I didn't want to burn five hours each way at this time.

## Counseling and Dennis

Dennis agreed to be my "advocate".
The idea of an advocate seemed strange, but I found that other
counseling services and ministries do the same thing. Jim agreed
to move our meetings to Friday to better accommodate Dennis' schedule.

So we met. It was cold. It had snowed.
Jim mentioned that both he and Dennis were wearing flannel
and I had on short sleeves. I said, "I have layers.".

I had gone over Ephesians 1, 2, and 3 for at least the third time.
I had noted some 30 "I ams" from that scripture, ways the saints
are described: blessed, redeemed, sealed, made holy, saved, etc.
Jim is trying to firmly establish the VERTICAL relationship.

Homework for next time is to go over Ephesians 4, 5, and 6
and note the "I wills", what the saints are to DO.
That's the HORIZONTAL, which only works when the vertical is solid.

## Meetings

Leaving the counseling session, I had a work call. Just my own team.
There would normally be a tech talk at that time, but we had no topic
for this week, so the organizer made it "chat and discussion".
Wow! Everyone loved it.

Work is a struggle. So much to learn (because I'm more techie
than salesy). But in this context, everything seems so pointless.

The week was a mixture: some days were productive. I keep thinking
that the move from professional services (more tech) to sales engineer
(obviously sales) was right, but there's still so much adjustment.

## Reviewing

I'm probably being more open than I should be.
This is, after all, a PUBLIC journal. The whole world can read it.
But several have said that they appreciate my candor, so I continue.

I'm struggling to stay on track. Even my dear Marilyn, the organized
one, could not have carried all these details on her own. Every day
I start with an 8.5x11 sheet of paper, listing things that must be done
that day. There are easily a half dozen backlog sheets from prior days.

## Inventory

Standing at the pantry stocked with too much crap
that I cannot use and missing a few things that I need,
something triggered the "she's gone" thought again.

I wanted to get angry, but it takes too much energy.
So I only let myself be sad.

## Kroger

When I got to Kroger, "Happy" was playing on the muzak.
It just doesn't fit!

I overheard a mother saying something to her daughter about
sparkling water. Still have plenty of Pellegrino at home,
which will probably never get used.

Walked down the cereal aisle. Thought about getting Lucky Charms.
I had gotten that over the summer when Marilyn was in Texas.
She didn't want me putting junk like that into my body. But she
wouldn't be mad about it if I finished it up before she got back,
right? Tonight I don't even want the stuff. Why is that?

This not wanting stuff ... I didn't even want to get more
Maker's Mark. Haven't had any liquor since September.

I realize 
this is the second time I've written about going solo to Kroger.

## Not Sleeping Well

Woke up around 2:30AM.
Had a weird dream.
Was tring to re-install some old staircase railing with a couple friends.
Marilyn was there. Gene too. I was waiting for one of the friends to come
back so we could finish the project. Marilyn was downstairs. I was afraid
she'd get away. "Wedding Bell Blues" was playing in my head and the voice
of Marilyn McCoo. Another Marilyn; how ironic. Thought to myself that I
would "do the knee thing", get it right this time.

## Daybreak

Woke up again just before 7 and got up.
Prayed, "what should I do today?".

Checked the house alarm before putting something in the garage.
At least I remembered to set that before crashing last night.

Snowing again.

Another 8.5x11 sheet of paper and a half dozen items to do.
