# Remembering

Remembering Marilyn ... when will the memories not bring tears?

Being alone is horrible. But for me it's also the lack of planning.
I mean that SHE was the organized one.

Woke up in a fright: work stuff.
Will I do well with the presentation practice?

## Memories Hurt ... or not

When will the memories not be sad? When will they be just memories,
reminders of what we had instead of reminders of what I've lost?

Last night, Tim Allie was in Grove City and took me to dinner.
We talked about life, work, our kids. We talked about church,
that so many people put their pastors up on a pedistal and then
neglect praying for them. Peoplez gotta stop that.

At one point in the conversation, I was remembering Marilyn.
There was no sadness. The memory did not cause pain!
That's not a first, but it's still not the norm. I miss her.

## An Anchor ... or not

The house is a time capsule (still).
Sometime Monday, I had the thought:
this home is an anchor for Chelle and Martin.

Or maybe not. Do they need it? Do they know what they need?

When Gene and Jo Ann moved from Lufkin to Corpus Christi,
it was the end of an era. They had lived on Reen Drive for
FIFTY YEARS. For me, it was the loss of an anchor.

My parents moved. A LOT.
Not complaining: they were wonderful, and it was wonderful
to get to visit with them wherever they lived. But there was no
"homestead" for my sister and me like Marilyn and her brothers had.

Where is the "homestead" for Chelle and Martin? or for me?

This morning, I went to the downstairs fridge for waffles.
Am hungry. (Appetite is probably a good sign.) I happened to see
a small box with some old papers. Decided to get rid of this box.
The stuff goes back to 2006 ... but it has her handwriting on it.
I managed to get rid of it.

So much clean-up to do. So much everything to do.

## Walking

Temprerature outside Monday was 60! Praise God!
So I got to walk. Headed down through Southern Grove for a change.
(This leads to the YMCA for those who know the area.) Saw Tom.

"Do you walk at regular times"

"No. Just when I feel like it."

Well so much for trying to schedule walking with Tom.

We talked for a bit. He suggested that I move (to Virginia).
I remembered that thought from earlier, that the house is an anchor.
Is it an anchor? In any case, I told Tom that I'm not doing anything
for a year, not doing anything right away. He understood.

So cold this morning. I desperately need to get OUT of the house.

## A Blast from the Past

Someone that I follow on Twitter was a guest on the Point of View
radio show. (Dallas) I can't remember the last time I heard this show.
Had to quit listening to Marlin Maddoux when he got too political,
but the host these days is Kerby Anderson. I remembered the theme music.
Kinda made me depressed. The past! The past! I'm stuck in the past!!

The past seems to affect me. Can someone explain it? Can someone help?

Found Point of View on Stitcher (the podcast app I use).
Queued up the episode with B. Tyler Ellis (the guy from Twitter).
Maybe listen to it while driving to/from Cedarville.
And there's that theme music.

Cedarville: There's another Grief Share group. I went.
It felt strangely comfortable, oddly safer than the GS group at home.

## Washing for One

Washing clothes.
I'd be happy to wash for two. But it's just me.

"Oh God! I know you're with me. But I'm hurting."

I saw one of her pictures from high school.
Picked it up and cried. Hard.
