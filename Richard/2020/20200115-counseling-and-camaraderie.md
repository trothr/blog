# counselor

Today I met with Jim Stevanus for counseling.

I'm trying to get all the help I can.
Have not yet been able to meet with a grief group,
but I need to dig deeper than just the grief.

## What's His Name?

My sister helped get me connected with a counselor.
I spoke with Steve Etner two weeks ago. The organization he
works with did not have any references in my home area.
So Diane called others.

Wen she spoke with Jim Stevanus, my story sounded familiar
to him. "What's your brother's name?" and then "I know him!".
Jim's daughter knows us, had heard about Marilyn, and had told
her parents. Turns out that Jim and Jacquie were parents in the
same home schooling group. Their daughter graduated with Martin.

## Getting the Root Right

Jim let me share my story and then told me how his ministry works.
He said that he wants to get at the heart of the matter,
which I very much want to do.

Jim also mentioned "identity". That's something Steve Etner talked
about, which I suspect is part of the heart. (For Christians, there is
a need to identify with Christ.) Jim didn't dwell on "identity",
but I'm hoping it will be a significant part of his plan.

He cited Matthew 15:19, James 1:14-15, and Hebrews 4:12.

## An Advocate

So ... finally in formality ... glimmers of hope.

The onl downside is that this ministry wants the counselee to bring
an advocate to go through it with them. Jim said that he's flexible,
particularly in a case like mine, but stressed that he believes
it really will help. I have only a handful of men who I would
dare to impose on to be my "advocate", but I will try.

## The Grind

The rest of the day was uneventful.
I was unable to walk because of the weather.
I plowed through some email and joined a short customer call.
I'm behind on some follow-up from a customer call from yesterday.

My eyes are getting bad.
I need to make an appointment. (It's been a year.)

## Unexpected Camaraderie

Men's group tonight, and I planned to go again to
"the library group".

I went to the library ahead of the meeting, took both laptops.
Got a wee bit of work done. Then saw the guys gathering.

The library had to shuffle rooms and put us into a room
rated for four people. (I would have said two!) We were five,
and staff had to come tell us that fire code mandates no more
than four. Where do we go?

My place!

Considering other places we might go,
our house is just a couple miles from the library
and would be more suitable than the cantina or the brewery.
So the group came over. It was nice! It was great to have people
in the house.

Earlier in the day, I was again pondering "Why do I have this place?".
Well, God provides, and there's one answer. Praise God! So an
otherwise somber day ended on a high note. Thank you, Lord.
