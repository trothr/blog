# He is Risen!

Today is Resurrection Day!

The Lord is Risen!
(Your response: He is risen indeed!)

## Soccer Fields at Sunrise

I had it in mind to watch the sunrise for Resurrection morning.

Several times, I've attended a sunrise service on Easter Sunday.
This year, many people held sunrise services in one way or another.
But they were all way different from last year, different from the norm.

I drove to one of the ponds in my neighborhood. Normally I would walk,
but it was chilly so I drove. When I got there, the bench I thought I
remembered did not exist. Oh well! I drove another couple blocks to the
soccer fields, which are closed. I parked at the gate and watched
the sun come up. There were some clouds, but the sun pierced through.

## Seven O'clock Service

I came back home and caught Jerry Neal at First Baptist via Facebook.
His sermon today cleverly related the stone covering the tomb,
something which must be removed, to sin in our lives,
something which must be removed.

This was the "sunrise service".

Sun was already up, but I guess that's fitting,
since the Son was already risen when the disciples came to the tomb.

## World Changers

Trent invited me again this week to join the "life group"
that he and Michele host. So I joined. The name of their life group is
"World Changers". It was great to be able to participate.

We studied Hebrews.
(Naturally, when one hears "he brews", one must have coffee.)
Two verses stood out, 10:19 "Therefore, brethren, having boldness to
enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, ...", and 10:23 "Let us hold
fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised
is faithful.".

I also caught part of the worship service from Granger.
They began with a "virtual choir" which was really effective,
worked out well! (How did they do that?)

I also caught part of the worship service from McLean.

I later got to watch my niece's church in Duncan, OK.
They drove to church, sat in their cars, and honked for "amen".

## Together in a Zoom Room

My sister's husband scheduled a Zoom meeting for the family.
We spent an inordinately long time gawking at their new puppies
and had great fun just hanging out together.

I was reminded of Easter services from years ago. My sister had been
speaking with her good friend and sometime roommate about Easter
sunrise services we all attended at White Rock Lake in Dallas.
Those were joyful times.

Sometimes joy sneaks in, like the sun piercing those clouds.

## New Life

He is Risen!

The tomb is empty. This is the central event of history.

Many of my friends and family are believers.
Many of my friends and family are not.
If you are not, I don't mean to twist your arm,
but do think about this fact and don't miss out.

"*Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;
old tings have passed away; behold, all thinsg have become new.*"
II Corinthians 5:17
