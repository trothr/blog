# Five Days

I've been back at the house in Ohio for five days.

How am I doing? (Everyone asks. I'm asking too!)

Today I read Psalm 13. The first verse is right where I'm at.
The alst verse is right where I want to be, where I THOUGHT I was,
until my plans were shattered 30 days ago.

## The Weekend

Yesterday seemed to go alright.
But this morning not so much. Actually, the whole weekend was difficult,
though yesterday I did see several friends face-to-face. I spoke with
Trent at church. Also saw Russ and Jim, two technical friends.
And I had dinner with Dennis. So it's up-and-down.

## Today

I had a good phone call with Chelle while she drove to work.

This morning, I had an appointment with my doctor.
Originally, I was going in for blood work, so I thought I should fast:
no breakfast (though I was hunry) and no coffee (which might have
messed up my mental schedule).

I turned on the TV to catch the weather.
Watching the morning news while drinking coffee and tea
had become a ritual for Marilyn and me. No coffee. No Marilyn.

Just before 9AM, I kinda started to freak out.

The regular weather guy, Buck, was not there.
The usual substitute, Phil, was not there.
Some new gal was doing today's weather.
Where's the usual weather guy?

I've been told that you can just show-up to Grief Share.
So I got on their web site and looked for other Grief Share groups
nearby. There's one in Cedarville tonight. I will go there if I
don't wind up having other plans.

Update: that group has not started. The leader is in the hospital.
Where the hell do I go?!?!?

## Doctor's Office

Went to see my doctor.
Got a sore throat and related symptoms while in Indiana.
Mostly cleared up, but at the request of SEVERAL who said,
"get it checked out", I went to get it checked out.
(And have blood drawn as was previously planned.)

It's a new year, so the office had me review some things.
(Used to be done with paper. Now it's done on an iPad tablet.)

I had to change my emergency contact.

I had to change my marital status.

I had to change my "wellness profile" (the how-depressed-are-you stuff).

Told the nurse about my life change. She told the doctor.
He ensured that I have plans to get help. He could also recommend
a psychologist if things don't work out with counseling.
And he likes the Grief Share group.

## Finally Breakfast

Got back home. Quickly made some eggs and coffee.

I accidentally tapped "Music" on my phone.
That brought up "Knees to the Earth" which I had played
for Marilyn when she was in the ICU.

Didn't actually eat breakfast until 11:25.

Chelle and Martin both recommended lavender oil
as a calming and "centering" aide. So I grabbed some lavender oil
from the kitchen cabinet. ALL of the essential oils are stuff that
Marilyn ordered! I can't escape the loss!

I think it's just really hitting me that SHE'S GONE.
Creaping up on me ... from last week ... and the weekend ... now today.

I'll have to ammend this.
