# Quarantine and Shamrocks

Today is St. Patrick's Day.

Today, much of the US population are "shelter in place" quarantined.

## Houston to Denver

34 years ago today, Marilyn and I were on our honeymoon.
After two nights in Houston, we flew to Denver and then drove to Granby.
We had green champagne on the plane.

This past Sunday was our anniversary.
I was in Virginia with Chelle and Martin. We toasted to Mom,
hiked the Marilyn side of Great Falls, and took in two great movies.

## Shamrocks

The quarantine is impacting everyone.
People are thinking up creative ways to cope.
One neighbor suggested a "shamrock hunt": put a shamrock in your window.
She and her kids would walk the neighborhood and count the shamrocks.
No human interaction needed.

I didn't see many other shamrocks. I do hope they found a good count
on their hunt. Seems like a great idea!

## Quarantine

Working from home has been difficult.
When you have solid community connections, working from home is great!
But I've lost a lot of "connections". Marilyn was my biggest "connector",
though I lost a lot of connectedness before I lost her.

Lots of people working from home who have not before.

Ironically, lots of students being *home schooled* for the first time.

Seems like every day I learn something new.
Today I see this lock-down as forcing me to continue *through*
the aloneness. God is good.

Two months ago I would have been so angry about this.
Today, I'm sad, but I'm not angry. I know God has a plan.
I know that He is in control. I know that He loves me.

Romans 8:28 ... through at least v32.

## Sad but Okay

Thank God the US Mail still arrived.
In today's pile was a store catalog for Marilyn.
That ambushed me: tears flowed. This happens. It's going to happen.

I'm okay.

Thank you to the friends and family who have prayed for me
and called me and visited me ... God is good and I thank HIM
for your support. The journey is long, but I do see God's hand.

I'm sad again/still, but I'm okay. Don't worry; just pray.
Not just for the kids and me, but lots of others needing prayer today.
And thank God for His provision.
