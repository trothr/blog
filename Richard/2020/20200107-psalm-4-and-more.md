# Paslm 4 and More

My sister suggested that I read Psalms.

My "quiet time" is little more than just reading a chapter
from the Bible. Used to be more. Where did it go?
(Another thing on the pile.)

## Psalm 3

So I took up the recommendation, started reading Psalms.
Chapter 3 was tough, especially verse 4. So much that I know
to be true has been hidden from me of late. Most obvious,
I cried out that He would heal my wife and He did not.
So ... "He heard me from his holy hill" ... is hard to take.

## Hear My Prayer

But then there's chapter 4: "Hear me when I call ...
Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.". This is my request!

In the grieving process, countless people have reminded me
that anger is part of it. I've been angry. So then there's
verse 4: "Be angry, and do not sin. Meditate within your heart
on your bed, and be still.". Okay, will do.

## Psalm 5

When I was in high school, someone had put Psalm 5 to music.
It was one of the songs we sang in youth group. EVERY time I read
Psalm 5 I remember that old song. (The song only covers the first
three verses, as I recall. But it's good.)

## Deliver Me!

6:2 through 6:5 describe exactly where I am right now.

"Have mercy on me, for my bones are troubled.
My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O Lord - how long?"

MY soul is indeed troubled. How long before I see His mercy?

"Return, O Lord, deliver me!
Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake!
For in death there is no remembrance of You;
in the grave who will give you thanks?".

Some have said to me that death is a part of life.
That's not accurate. From the begining, death was not part of the plan.

## Weary of Groaning

6:6 and 6:7 ... heck ... just go read them

I can relate. The tears continue to flow.
Whether sadness or anger, it's all a load. I'm tired, weary.

I realized yesterday, consciously, that I want to be happy again.
I realized then too, that I must let go of the anger for that to happen.

Then the cycle seemed to loop back and I was depressed again.

## Today

So today I'm at Psalm 7.
It's all about God defending us against an enemy.
Not especially comforting with respect to loss.

At the end, "I will praise the Lord according to His righteousness,
and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.".
Hopefully I can do that again soon.
