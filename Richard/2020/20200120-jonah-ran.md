# Jonah Ran

Yesterday (Sunday) we attended church with the Santonicolas.
The sermon covered Jonah chapter 1.

## Jonah's Assignment

When the Lord gave Jonah his assignment, he ran away.

His job was simple. But he was afraid. The Ninevites *might*
take his life.

He was also bitter. The Nineveh was the ancient
Assyrian capitol and Jonah's hatred of those people ran deep.

Eventually, Jonah was swallowed by the fish, came to his senses,
cried out to God, preached to the Ninevites, and wrote about it.

## Rick's Assignment

What is Rick's assignment?

Right now, Rick must pursue healing. He also must continue in the
new role at work. But he is afraid. Healing takes time, and the
support group is a bunch of people with their own lives.

He is also bitter.
It's been 37 days. The emotions are still raw.

## A Dream

Yesterday morning, I had a dream. Again God gave me some task.
I kicked against it, wanting my old life back instead. (Which simply
WILL NOT HAPPEN.) Then I regretted it. I told the Lord, "I am willing.".
I was content. Waiting. Then I woke up and had some peace.

This morning (Monday), I remembered Marilyn often saying, "oh bother",
in a voice she and I derived from Winnie the Pooh. It's how we both
observed minor problems which deserved no attention.

I miss her so much.

From Psalm 20 verse 9, "Save, Lord! May the Kng answer us when we call."
