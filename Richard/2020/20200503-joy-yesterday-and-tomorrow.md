# Joy Yesterday And Tomorrow

The theme of the Grief Share program is
"from Mourning to Joy". When I first participated in that program,
I had my doubts.

## Joy Yesterday

I've been waiting, wondering when my memories would turn from
sadness, focused on the loss. Wondering when the memories would
be joyful, not painful. It can happen. It is starting to happen.

Friday was a good day. Really. And as it happened, I stumbled upon
a smart phone video of Marilyn, Michelle, Martin, and me. We were
sending Christmas greetings to the Indiana crew. This video is
at least two years old. I was fine. No tears, just a great memory.

Later, I was listening to a podcast with Vince and Jo Vitale
and Abdu Murray. Vince cited John 11:35, "Jesus wept.". That was
a well-timed reminder and got me choked up. The God who made me
knows my heart, knows my pain, and has endured worse pain on my behalf.
So I shared it on Facebook.

I AM SO BLESSED.
Most (all?) of my FB connections know the recent story and are
so incredibly supportive. With this post, I felt like I had been
deceptive because I wasn't feeling a grief overload. But I will
not turn away any help I can get! Praise God!

Music helps.

The music is starting to come back. I want more!
I love it. I have missed it. Before Marilyn got sick,
I had lost the music. Then losing her pushed me even harder.
So now I'm on my knees, and that's okay.

This house is filled with photos.

## Joy Today

Speaking of music, A friend sent the following and said to play it
LOUD, to the point of making my speakers shut-off. (I have a nice
Kenwood receiever that I bought for Marilyn. It realy will shut off
when it gets pushed too hard. Hah!)

I've played it more than a dozen times over the past three or four days.

Today First Baptist held *drive-in* church services.
It was great just to *be there* with the rest of the congregation.

A couple weeks ago, I saw the online view of drive-in service
at Misty's church. Nice!

We say "amen" a lot. (I know. Shocking, eh?)
As I've heard other churches do, we did the honk-your-horn thing
just like at Misty's church. Yessss!!! What joy!!!

Yesterday I visited with a good friend from Grief Share
who also lost a spouse. We were able to talk candidly about
our loved ones. It was a breath of fresh air, such release
to be able to reflect on how Marilyn and I first met, a two-way
street, not all about me. Joy. And I didn't even cry.

## Joy Tomorrow

It's Sunday.
I needed lunch.
Mr unstructured is running out of things to fix! (There's a place
up the road that might be able to help. They call themselves Kroger.
I should check them out.) Found some Asian skillet stir-fry. Ahhhhh.....
And used Mamaw's reliable cast-iron skillet.

As I was cooking, I was thinking about the kids.
When will *they* have joy again? They are just starting out "adulting".
The four of us were so close, so many sites seen, places visited.
The three of us are so close, so many sites to see, places to visit.

Oh dear God please heal the holes in our hearts.

For a moment, I thought I could only enumerate joys from times past.
Then the Lord seemed to say that I can count on joy in times to come
because He will be there, He will bless us, He has plans.
He took Marilyn; she now has joy. He left us here; He wants to give us joy.

So this was a light that went on:
It's not just the joy that we've had, nor the joy that we experience
right this minute, but also the joy in the future, "because Jesus".
He is the source of our joy and He is the same yesterday, today,
and forever.

Jason txted today, checking up on me.
This man is so great. We know each other from work. He's with IBM
and was assigned to Nationwide while I was there. Turns out he is also
a Believer. Turns out he also lost his wife. That was three years ago.
Since then, he has leaned-in. Jason has become part of my mosh-pit.
He reminded me that relationships matter.

Friends old and new have been huge. We were designed for community.

Look for the joy because more will come. Focus on the Provider.
Try to relax. Don't be afraid to cry for help.
