# Broken Souvenir

Just broke something memorable.

## What About This?

I went to the game room (half level down, but not a basement)
to open the window. It's nice outside today, but very windy.
The fresh air would help, so I opened one window in the dining room
and went down to open another at the other end of the house.

To the right of this particular window is (was!)
a Delft Blue model windmill. This is something Marilyn and I
picked up on our trip to Amsterdam (and on down to Delft,
obviously) around 2002.

It was a business trip, but I made sure she came along.
We loved it! Very tiring, but great to get "across the pond".

What do I do with this thing?

## Memorable Trip

Most people make a point to see the Anne Frank house when they
go to Amsterdam. We skipped it. The line was unbelievably long.
But we got something better.

On the rail ride to Delft, we stopped at Haarlem.
That's where the ten Boom family lived. Many of you will
know about the story of "The Hiding Place", where the ten Booms
hid Jews during World War II.

We took the tour. We saw the hiding place, the real thing.

We stood *in* the hiding place.

## On to Delft

We continued on southward, got to Delft, did some shopping.

My dad's brother had visited Netherlands many times and had
given us tourism tips. Others had also made recommendations.
Delft Blue is the stuff to get, so we got some. (Yeah, yeah,
we also saw those shops where certain herbal varieties are sold.)

So this windmill treasure was sitting on the ledge of that window
in the game room. I noticed it and wondered what I should do with it,
being one of many mementos around the house that are/were only
meaningful to Marilyn and me as a couple.

I'm starting to get overwhelmed.
Marilyn and I both collected too many trinkets as memorabilia.

## Fallen Blinds

As I tried to open the window,
the blinds came loose and crashed onto the few keep sakes
there on the ledge. The little windmill fell to the floor.
All four of its sales broke off.

I was crushed. I lost it.

What do I do with this thing now?

I'm stuck: I could throw it away, but can't bring myself to do that.
I could try and glue the sails together, but really *don't* have
time for that just now. (Actually have a list of things that
*must* be done today.)

For about four days, I've been in a deepening funk.
Is this just another cycle of grief?

I can't do this.
