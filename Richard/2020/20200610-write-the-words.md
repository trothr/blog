# You Write the Words

My life, as I knew it, ended with Marilyn's departure.

But I am still here. What now?

## A Really Cool Story

When Marilyn was first admitted to Wexner Medical Centar (Ohio State),
I called and emailed several friends for prayer. Top on my list was Glenn.

I don't remember the timing of the following conversation, but it had
dawned on me that the situation was very serious. I told Glenn that I
believed her recovery would take a straight-up miracle. Glenn shared
some of his own experience with true miracles which I should not repeat
here and now. We both believed, still do, that God intervenes, God heals,
God works miracles even in the 21st century.

Even at the time, there was a desire to show God's glory, to tell
a story about His work in our lives. For Marilyn to recover ...

*"That would be a really cool story."*

I could barely get out the words. Choked up even now as I write this.

Glenn was so compassionate. He hasn't endured this kind of loss,
but he's known so many who have, and some who've had worse.

Recovery isn't the story God wrote for us at that time.
The picture He painted was her going Home. (Capital "H" there.)
That turned out to be beautiful (I will be writing about it)
even though it was so painful.

## The Author and Perfecter

*"... looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,
Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising
the shame, and has  sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."* --
Hebrews 12:2 (NKJV, see NASB for "perfecter")

My life is over ... but ... I'm still here. So what now?

Since Marilyn's "graduation", things have slowly gotten better.

It was back in January when I had that dream,
initially kicking against something God was offering.
(Whatever it was wasn't clear in the dream.) I ended up saying "okay"
in the dream. Since then, in real life, the anger has dissipated.
My mourning has slowly turned into joy. There is life even though I am alone.

There's a song by FFH (Jeromy and Jennifer Diebler and crew),
"You Write the Words".

What will He write? What picture will He paint?
I don't know. Sometimes I'm scared to think about what might come
because I don't want to imagine something other than what He has planned.
I don't want to paint something less beautiful than His vision.

What about the dreams?
Bob Klund put it well when we saw him in December, "dreams have been
shattered". I want to re-build those dreams, picking up the shattered
pieces, giving them to God to make something beautiful.

What about my family?
So thankful to have Chelle and Martin. Just the three of us now.
We've had some refreshing times together this year. I want more!
What about *their* dreams? Dear God, please put it all together.

*"Here's my song. You write the words.
Here's my heart. You write the words."*
