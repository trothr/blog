# Business Trip

I had to go to New Jersey to meet with a channel partner.

This is a three-day post.

## First Trip

This was my first business trip since losing Marilyn.

It was harder than I expected.

What was harder?
For one thing, I had to turn around for a couple things I forgot.
But the real difficulty was just getting all organized for the trip.
Packing, sure, but more: the planning, what to take.

## Weather Lady

I've mentioned that Marilyn loved watching the weather,
seeing storms, tracking things. As I left Columbus this morning,
it was raining. I wished I could hear from Marilyn,
how long the rain would last, where I might expect clearing.

I wished she was there to talk to me about the weather.

## Penna Turnpike

I stopped at one of the Pensylvania Turnpike service centers for coffee.

Last time I was at this particular service center I was with Marilyn.

Like always, I queued-up podcasts and listened to them:
Tony Evans, Breakpoint, Ravi Zacharias, Darknet Diaries.
Trying to make the best use of the time, a very long drive.
Would like to get some audio books.

AGAIN, no fits of rage. Praise God!
But the sadness and grief seem to be mounting.

## Dinner with Kevin

Met my teammate Kevin for dinner.
I had found Stage House Tavern. Some team members responded
that they liked that choice, and it was a great place!

Turns out Kevin lives in Dallas (Plano actually). Wow.
He moved his family to Texas from Michigan sometime around 1996.
He has three daughters and three grandchildren.

Why did we ever leave Texas?

## Happy Birthday Jo Ann

Today was Jo Ann's birthday.
I tried several times to call her while on the road.
She said her ringer is misbehaving. (Given the nature of smart phones,
I believe her!) We finally connected. She got the flower arrangement
from the kids. Yay! She sounded so happy! And she said it had been
a good day. Praise God!

While I was at dinner, I missed a call, but Jo Ann left voice mail.
She had also gotten the chocolate strawberries. Yay! So that was
another thing to cheer her up. Praise God!

## Back to the Hotel and Back to the Future

Back at hotel after dinner. Wanted to call Marilyn and talk to her.

Tried to *not* turn on the TV, but eventually did.
Back to the Future was showing. That's the movie we saw
the night I asked her to marry me.

Things like the movie don't depress me ... at least not directly.
Maybe they add to the pile of emotions? I don't know. There's definitely
a pile of emotions. Some people see progress, but I'm not so sure.

Turns out it's a bit depressing *now* to write about it.

## Success Criteria

Kevin and I went to the business partner's office.
Their team escorted us downstairs to a machine room
(raised floor, air handlers, racks and racks of computers).
I had not been in a machine room for probably FIVE years.

Kevin installed his product. I installed my product.
We demonstrated for the partner's team how things work.
They were *very* happy with the results. Praise God!
It was a real pleasure to be working with other techies again.

We passed the "success criteria".
One part of my product didn't work quite right, but it gives me
an excuse to go do a little more coding. I really like coding.
Wish I could do more. (Wish certain leaders would *use* what I write.)

## Carolyn and Frank

After my time with the business partner, I drove from Somerset
up to Demarest to have dinner with Carolyn and Frank. It's amazing
how accurate the navigator app is. It kept guessing I'd arrive at 7:15
and that's exactly when I got there. Memories in this house from my
childhood. Diane and I stayed with them at length one summer.

In those days, Uncle Frank found his old Heathkit W5M amplifier
and FM-3A tuner and gave them to me. I tinkered with them; had a blast!

Back to current time. I had a great visit with Carolyn and Frank.
(For those who don't know, Carolyn is my mom's sister.)
I almost wonder if the whole trip was just a God thing
for me to get to see them. Aunt Carolyn expressed that she hopes
they'll see more of me in coming months. (My official territory
now covers the area, so that's likely.)

Going back to the hotel took the better part of an hour.
I started to zone out. Needed some tunes! So I brought up the
Android music player. This meant I had to listen to some songs that I
had been putting off. In particular, Knees to the Earth was still there.
It did not kill me. I made it through the song.

This is one of my favorite songs. It's deep. It's worship.
But significantly, I had played it for Marilyn while she was in ICU
and hoped to tell her, "I played this for you while you were in the ICU.",
when she recovered.

Music affects me. Why? I don't know. Does it affect other people?
Diane said music affects Chelle. I did not know that, but probably should
have recognized it. I was struggling before (with respect to music),
but now with the hole in my heart ... I just don't know. So it was GOOD
that I was able to listen to these tracks without collapsing into tears.

## Return Trip

Packing up.
Am I forgetting anything?
Reminds me of the trip we took for our first anniversary.
She left a gown on a hanger in the bathroom. The hotel mailed it to us.

I walked the treadmill. Praise God! Was afraid I was late, but then saw
that I had a solid two hours. So I also checked some work email. (It had
to be done.) Then suddenly my extra time was gone! Ouch. Now having to rush.

I miss her so much.
Going home now. But why? She's not there.

Some days I just don't feel like doing anything. I have work.
It makes me get up, get on-line, interact with email at least,
maybe have some phone calls.

I've cried out to God a lot.
It's become just that: a cry, not a scream. That's progress.
And He provides! Praise God! But I'm scared. What if I stumble?

The sadness and grief seem to be mounting.

I was hurting before Marilyn got sick.
Is my grief compounded by the prior problem?
Or is the older burden compounded by this tragic loss?

## Mens' Group

Got back home in time to do a bit of clean-up before the guys arrived.

It was five of us this week: Trent, Jeff, Steve, Bill, and me.
Tony didn't show. Bruce didn't either. We got into Ephesians chapter 3.

Bill said I'm a good host. Thanks Bill.

As I finish writing this,
I'm again at Starbucks, using their WiFi,
avoiding the big empty house. Dunno how much more I can take.
