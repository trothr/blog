# untitled Saturday

In the gameroom is one of our diffusers, the kind used with
essential oils and fragrances. I happened to notice it Friday night.
Wait ... how'd this get here? Oh yeah, I put it here
when I was trying to help sooth Marilyn's discomfort from the
GALLBLADDER pain and nausea, which turned out to be NOT her
gallbladder.

## Breaking Hearts in a Good Way

I mentioned what Danny Davids posted on Facebook a couple weeks back.
Janice Ann Rowe writes the "Life" column in the Lufkin Daily News
and I forwarded to her what Danny wrote. She said she wanted to
publish it. She also said she'd send copies to several of us.

My copy arrived today.

I wrote down John 5:24. I think it's the verse of the day from
YouVersion:

"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him 
who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but 
has passed from death into life."

THANKS to those who called today: Diane, Dennis, Steven, Chris.
Thanks also to those who txted or sent email.

## Bills and Bitterness

The finances are overwhelming,
even though most are on automatic.
I did manage to get a new "FlyLady Calendar" ordered, just barely.

I tinkered with paying some of the medical bills.
Had to go through Marilyn's purse looking for one of the cards.
Found her driver's license.

That was it: tears and sobbing.
There are three purses hanging on the bathroom door,
all just the way she left them. One even has the monogrammed napkin
from Corey and Maggie's wedding, the last time Marilyn and I danced.

## Trying Activities

Saturday ... I should get out and do something.

A new gun range opened and it's in Grove City.
They're offering discounts for the opening, so I got a membership
and a free class.

The big event for today was the Ohio RV and Boat Show.
Marilyn and I wanted to get another RV from the time Chelle
moved to Virginia (maybe even before that). We talked about
trying to see the RV show. Today was my chance to do that.

At the show, there were families with children looking for
trailers with bunks. There were couples without children
(presumably retirees) looking for lounge-on-wheels type motorhomes.
There were young couples without kids trying to figure out
what they were interested in.

Of the thousands who were there, I think I was the only single guy.

The show was held at the Expo Center at the Ohio State Fair Grounds.
Last time I was at this place was with Marilyn. I clearly remembered
and could not get away from that memory. Wish she was there.

Josh and Christina were there! I heard Josh say to Talan,
"Wanna say hi to Rick?". Christina's parents were there too.
It was nice to see known neighbors.

The very smell of some of the trailers reminded me of that
four-year span when we too had a travel trailer. The whole experience
of RV browsing was something that I wished Marilyn was with me.

Get this: one of the units on display is called "Solitude".
Seriously?? [sigh]

## TV and Titans

I watched the Tennesee Titans defeat the Baltimore Ravens.
Scott txted that two Crimson Tide alumni were playing against
each other so the game got more interesting. 
Fell asleep during the latter half. Woke up just before midnight.

Also watched bits and pieces of several movies.

I guess today was a step. It didn't feel like much. God help me!

What will I do tomorrow?

## The Wind Howls

The wind is whipping around outside the house.
Storms were predicted and it rained at the expo center.

The wind is making the house creak.

Mark Mundel sent me a message via Facebook
that Lois Evans died on December 30. Wow ... how did I miss that?
She had biliary cancer (the bile ducts leading from the liver)
which is similar to Marilyn's condition.

Tony Evans spoke for more than a half hour at his wife's memorial.
I could not do that. But I do pray this, "Lord, shine your glory
through our life.".

May I see God's plan. May my eyes look toward Him.
He has placed Eternity in my heart; let me not kick against that.

I guess I understand Genesis 2:18 better now.
But I don't understand the time that I am in.
Just hoping that I don't squander it. Am anxious to
let go of the anger, heal, help, do stuff that matters.
