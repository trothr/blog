# Triple Tap

A "double tap" is two shots are fired in rapid succession.

Here, a "triple tap" is three.

## Three Month Cycle

I was told that grief comes in three month cycles.
Since I'm looking at three months since Marilyn passed,
I dread what's coming.

Is this "three month cycle" effect a scientific observation?
Or is it just what someone said, making a rough estimate
or trying to explain their own understanding?

## March 14 and 13 and 15

March 14 is this coming Saturday. That's three months.

The day before, a certain movie comes out that caught my attention.

The 15th is our 34th wedding anniversary.

I was already frustrated by the proximity of the movie release
with our anniversary *before* noticing the three-month marker.

Even if the "three month cycle" isn't a real thing,
the 14th is a real thing for me.

So that's the triple tap: 13, 14, and 15, hitting in quick succession.

## I Still Believe

The movie is "I Still Believe".
It's about Jeremy Camp and Melissa Lynn Henning-Camp.
I'm a big fan of Jeremy Camp.

Melissa was diagnosed with ovarian cancer shortly before they married.
I don't know the full story, but what I do know is inspirational.
She loved Jesus Christ with her whole heart.

I forget exactly when and how I was first introduced to Jeremy Camp's
music, but I have been a fan for a long time. His album "Restored"
is fantastic, a real favorite. Turns out that "Restored" was itself
inspired by God's work in Jeremy's life after Melissa died.

I had no idea. Did not know any of the Melissa story when I first
heard the music. But then I heard, and now there's a movie. Cool!

## What are your Plans?

I shared this dilema with the Monday Grief Share group.

"What are your plans for the weekend?"

I *was* going to see the movie ... maybe.
Not really keen on watching movies alone ... ever.
But I don't have anyone to go with.

The group unanimously said "don't". Then what else?

I could go see the kids. Long drive. Would also mean interrupting
my attendance at the Sunday Grief Share group ... again.
But this being Mom and Dad's anniversary weekend, it does
make sense to go see them.

I could go see Diane and Scott. Less of a drive.

decisions, decisions

That business trip last week took more out of me than I realized.

## Solitude or Not

I'm "behind" enough that I'd really like to just sit.

One thing that has been on my mind is a particular blog post
for the tribute journal. It's been almost a month since I
posted anything about Marilyn, and there's lots to say.
Started something last week, but got interrupted.

Distinguishing SOLITUDE from ISOLATION is new for me.

I've been crushed by isolation to the point where I feared solitude.
But now I remember that solitude is that simple alone time which
even extroverts need.

Maybe not *this* weekend.
