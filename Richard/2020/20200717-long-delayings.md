# Long Delayings

When you suffer loss, get help! Don't put it off.

If you have the emotional energy, reach out on your own to get help.
Don't wait for someone to come grab you. Many friends and family
just don't know that they should do something, *what* to do,
nor even that they *can* help.

Here, I'm talking about loss of a loved one from this life.
Bear in mind there are other losses, most of which need grieving.

## When Mom Died

When my mom "graduated", Dad got help.
He tried to pursuade Marilyn and the kids and me to also get help.
In his case, he went with a Grief Share group. It made a big difference.

I remember having a really low opinion about it all.
For one thing, it felt clinical. The idea that a "group"
could help Dad heal seemed like psychotherapy. I'm no fan of most
psychotherapy. (Apologies to the psychologists. I don't consider *all*
of your work "clinical" or impersonal. It was just that situation.)
But I had no idea at that time how that group worked.
Turns out it was *effective*.

Another thing which rubbed me the wrong way was it seemed like Dad
was saying, "come on and get healed so that I can move forward".
That's NOT what he was trying to do. In fact, Dad kept moving in spite
of the laggings of me and mine. But I now understand why he urged us
to also "get healed": we needed healing!

Dad's innocent appeal was lost to my ignorance and misjudging.

To do nothing does not heal.
Some say "time heals", but time alone DOES NOT HEAL.
My own inaction after we lost my mom only allowed the pain of others
to persist. There's a ripple effect from everything we do (or do not).

## Getting Healing

I lost Marilyn in December. That grieving process has consumed a lot
of time and energy. My life was shattered. It has taken the support of
DOZENS of friends and family. But it is happening. The changes are
profound and surprising, but all good.

I've been told that I've worked hard, but I cannot take credit.
It was the constant support of family and friends. It was (and I don't
mean this in some mystical way) the Word of God soothing the scar.

Chelle and Martin were a huge help, from defending me against "triggers"
to intervening in family fights. They were with me in coping with
funeral plans. They've been with me in selecting Marilyn's monument.
But they're victims too. Supportive co-victims need help too.

One surprising thing is that it appears that I had not grieved Mom
until I also lost Marilyn. Why did I put it off? Oh yeah; see the
prior section of this blog post. I mistook offers of help as some
kind of forcing my hand. I was wrong.

I've got one friend for whom it's been ten years since his loss.
I recommended the Grief Share organization to him. After all this time,
he's doubtful it would help. But he *did* get other help. Not as if he
put things off. He got help, still does.

Losing my wife sent me into a tailspin. I was so angry. I could have
said to any supporting friend, "What do you care?". But to reject the
helping hand is to suck the love out of your friend for no good reason.

## Don't Delay

When I put-off grieving Mom's passing, it did no good for anyone.
In fact, my delay had several significant negative effects. From my
experience, I urge you, don't let your suffering set there, the anguish
to be dredged up later, because it will. You have a life to live.

Let me state that more strongly: It does not honor your late loved one
for you to linger in the loss. In fact, it DISHONORS the one you've
lost to maintain misery or to persist in pain.

I was busy enough with a new job that I didn't really notice.
I didn't go deep, didn't mentally unpack things that were difficult
and for which I had no reference or context. People suffer loss every day.
It hurts to think about. Most of us would like to box it in a corner
or make it go away. (But how do you "make it go away"? Can't get
your loved one back.)

Boxing the grief, putting it off, forcing it into the back corner,
only serves to let the pain fester. That's not healthy.

NOW is the optimum time to call for help.
TODAY is the day to take steps.

I remember, early after Marilyn's "graduation", wanting my life back.
I was so angry, probably knowing subconsciously that it simply could
not happen. Resolution lay in a different direction.

At some point, I took the direction of true remedy. God provided
several streams of support. I embraced all of them. God delivered me!
I was first no longer angry. Then slowly began to have peace, then joy,
and now happiness. I'm actually HAPPY most days. In fact, at this point,
the only significant pain I have is for family who are still hurting.

If you've lost someone, get help. Maybe find a Grief Share group.
Maybe see a Christian counselor or psychologist. Possibly visit with your
pastor. But don't put it off! And don't assume, as I did, that offers of
help come with strings or hidden agendas. Know instead that they come
with love.
