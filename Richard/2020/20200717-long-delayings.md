# Long Delayings

When you suffer loss, get help! Don't put it off.

If you have the emotional energy, reach out on your own to get help.
Don't wait for someone to come grab you. Many friends and family
just don't know that they should do something, *what* to do,
nor even that they *can* help.

## When Mom Died

When my mom "graduated", Dad got help.
He tried to pursuade Marilyn and the kids and me to also get help.
In his case, he went with a Grief Share group. It made a big difference.

I remember having a really low opinion about it all.
For one thing, it felt clinical. The idea that a "group"
could help Dad heal seemed like psychotherapy. I'm no fan of most
psychotherapy. (Apologies to the psychologists. I don't consider *all*
of your work "clinical" or impersonal. It was just that situation.)
But I had no idea at that time how that group worked.
Turns out it was *effective*.

Another thing which rubbed me the wrong way was it seemed like Dad
was saying, "come on and get healed so that I can move forward".
That's NOT what he was trying to do. In fact, Dad kept moving in spite
of the laggings of me and mine. But I now understand why he urged us
to also "get healed": we needed healing!

Dad's innocent appeal was lost to my ignorance and misjudging.

## Getting Healing

I lost Marilyn in December. That grieving process has consumed a lot
of time and energy. My life was shattered. It has taken the support of
DOZENS of friends and family. But it is happening. The changes are
profound and surprising, but all good.

One surprising thing is that it appears that I had not grieved Mom
until I also lost Marilyn. Why did I put it off? Oh yeah; see the
prior section of this blog post. I mistook offers of help as some
kind of forcing my hand. I was wrong.

I've got one friend for whom it's been ten years since his loss.
I recommended the Grief Share organization to him. After all this time,
he's doubtful it would help. But he *did* get other help. Not as if he
put things off. He got help, still does.

## Don't Delay

When I put-off grieving Mom's passing, it didn't help anything or anyone.
In fact, my delay had several significant negative effects.

I was busy enough with a new job that I didn't really notice.
But I didn't go deep, didn't mentally unpack things that were too painful
and which I had no reference or context. People suffer loss every day.
It hurts to think about. Most of us would like to box it in a corner
or make it go away. (But how do you "make it go away"? Can't get
your loved one back.)

Boxing the grief, putting it off, forcing it into the back corner,
only serves to let the pain fester. That's not healthy.

I remember, early after Marilyn's "graduation", wanting my life back.
I was so angry, probably knowing sub-consciously that it simply could
not happen. Resolution lay in a different direction.

At some point, I took the direction of true remedy. God provided
several streams of support. I embraced all of them. God delivered me!
I was first no longer angry. Then slowly began to have peace, then joy,
and how happiness. I'm actually HAPPY most days. In fact, at this point,
the only significant pain I have is for family who are still hurting.

If you've lost someone, get help. Maybe find a Grief Share group.
Maybe see a counselor or psychologist. Possibly visit with your pastor.
But don't put it off! And don't assume, as I did, that offers of help
come with strings or hidden agendas.
