# Gettin Hitched

We're gettin hitched!

I asked Susan that question men ask of women,
and she said "yes"!

## The Match

In the journey this year,
I was convicted to get healthy, to be a whole person.
I found that I'm better in union. Then I prayed that God would provide.

Susan and I met in a context of helping the hurting.
We wound up helping each other. We became friends.
As life proceeded, we became more than just friends.

I took care to walk carefully. Should we go this direction?
God put Susan right in front of me and said, "look".

*"Look at you, look at you, ... I'd be crazy not to."*

## To Marry

Genesis 2:18 ... most of y'all have heard it time and again.
The ONLY thing in Creation that was "not good" was that the man
was alone. Well, okay Lord.

Having been married, having known the unflinching committment
from a Godly woman, I could not help but embrace that again.
This gal loves Jesus more than she loves me, and that's exactly
what I'm lookin for.

So - I am engaged to be married to Susan Plemons.

Marriage is, among other things, an illustration of Christ and the Church.
While we're here, we want to honor Him and to share how God provides
and heals ... and loves us perfectly.

God is Good.
Pursue Him.
