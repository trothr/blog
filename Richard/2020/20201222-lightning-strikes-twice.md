# Lightning Strikes Twice

Yesterday marked one year since we buried Marilyn.
It's been a rough year. I'm okay now, and can reflect on the joys
that I've known and can embrace more of what God has provided.

## Remembering

I was so blessed. 
I've written that I "hit the jackpot" with Marilyn.
When she and I married, I was the stereotypical clueless 20-something
male. I was not the neanderthal some dad's fear for their daughters,
but I *was* ignorant. So much to learn about life.

Marilyn turned out to be better than I imagined,
and way better than I knew to pursue. She stuck with me for 33 years.
Most importantly: she loved the Lord.

Losing her was a shock that I still can't describe.
If you've lost a spouse, you know. If not, you don't want to know.

But God took care of me.

## Renewing

I didn't want to linger in the anger and brokenness. I sought help.
God provided several streams of hope and support.
It helped to meet people who also experienced loss,
hear their stories, share the grief, share the healing.

Some of these new friends became very special. Significantly,
Susan Plemons led the Grief Share group in Cedarville. We had a lot
in common, but most importantly: she loves the Lord.
Her joy in her faith is contagious. Her commitment is deep.

Susan and I turned out to have an amazing number of things in common,
from the places we had lived to our love for Chicago (the band).
Some of her journey was even more difficult than mine, but God took care
of her. We found we were going the same direction in life.

## Receiving

I've written elsewhere that, for relationships, one should make a list.
As I moved through recovery and started to think about relationship,
I wrote down a number of things that are important, what kind of person
I should relate to.

Susan matched every item, and then some.
I remain astonished. Lightning strikes twice when God says so.

People, hear me: receive what God provides.
As He provided a second time in my life, I embraced her.
Words fail. Knowing Susan is not something I did on my own.
It's incredible to see how He brought us together. Wow!

*Why am I so blessed?*
I don't deserve it. I see so many who are hurting, and I get it.
But God is bigger than our loss, bigger than our brokenness.
If He can take away our sin, He can certainly heal our hearts.

## Repurpose

One thing lost, even before Marilyn got sick, was my sense of purpose.
The Lord restored my purpose early this year and late last year.
I want to point to Him and help those who are going through stuff.

2020 has been a terrible year for most. In my own life,
while 2020 started out excruciating and tragic, it has turned into joy.

*"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace.
In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer,
I have overcome the world."* -- Jesus c/o John 16:33

God is good ... all the time.
