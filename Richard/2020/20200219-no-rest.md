# no rest

I can barely write today, but I have to write.

Didn't sleep well AT ALL last night. Worst so far.
Got in bed, tried to sleep, but sleep fled from me.
Got up around midnight, phone message to/from Martin
(who just happened to also be up), then watched a movie.
Eventually did fall asleep.

Back in bed, woke to another fright.
Those two conference rejections really hurt.
I'm also not getting much customer interaction (non-conference).
Not being the rep, what can I do about it? I'm working SO HARD
on those things which I CAN do. But what's my purpose??

Got up. Went to Chick-Fil-A. Got breakfast. Saw the graybeards.

Had to take the car to the dealer for service.
That was good in so far as giving me something to DO.
(And took the laptop and did some "work work" while waiting.)

While there, I visited with a friend. Call him Sam. (Not his real name.)
I've only known him since losing Marilyn. We have common friends on
a couple different fronts. But his life makes me sad: he's retired,
he's widowed, his family relations are all a stress mess.

The sadness and loneliness was almost overwhelming today.
Thankful that the guys are coming over tonight (mens' group).

Last night I had dinner with Tim again. (Thank you, Tim,
for your time.) He showed me a photo of the group he and Judy
had over for Christmas. I miss that. I SO MUCH miss the gatherings
we used to have, mostly family, mostly MARILYN'S family.



The memories are almost unbearable.
Got my new eyeglasses. (That's a story.)
Rounding the corner as I returned home, one of the neighbor houses
took me back to when we first moved here.

My world has gotten small. So small.

I prayed for help:
Got a brief note from Chris.
Got email from Coach Rich.
Got a nice phone call from Paul.
Praise God! Thank you Lord.
But I am in agony.

The guys should be here soon.
I'll update this later.

Dear God, please help!
