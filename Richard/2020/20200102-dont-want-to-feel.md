# Angry at God

A good friend saw a comment I made.
Not sure if it was in the journal/blog or if it was in email.
(I've slowed down on email. I don't think people have time for it.)
I said I was angry at God.

## Who's in Control?

This past summer, someone followed by another friend posted,
"God is not always in control.". WHAT? I had to take this on.
I had to challenge this. God is ALWAYS in control. (Though that
does not let us off the hook, and it somehow does not counter our
"free will". But that's getting too deep for me, and certainly
too deep for this blog.)

## Arguing and Asking Why

I went for a walk, just around the neighborhood.
I try to walk a mile or more each day. I talked to God ... out loud.
Kinda hoping that the neighbors don't think I'm crazy and kinda just
don't care.

"Why'd You take her?"

"I've got a back-log of problems/issues,
and YOUR solution is to take my wife from me?"

The friend who saw my "angry at God" comment pointed out that
we're not OWED anything. Some Christians in the US think life is
supposed to go a certain way. It's not. NO ONE is immune from suffering.
I know that and did not mean to imply that I thought I deserve
special treatment.

It just hurts.

God is the Author, and I don't like how He has written this story.

## Spiritual Surgery

Why the pain?

Dunno if it was from the Lord or just from memory,
but the thought came to mind that He is working to remove from me
some kind of "spiritual cancer". The idea is that ... and we know God
is working on all of us all the time ... there's a sort-of tumor
interfering with what I should be in God's plan. Surgery hurts.

"Just leave it!"

But it's killing you.

"Then leave it and let me die!", because it hurts so bad to remove it.

stop

What have I said?!?!? Oh, God, no.

If "it" is a spiritual cancer and "killing me" is an eternal illness,
then it MUST be cut out.

## I Don't Want to Feel

I think I have a lot of empathy.
I know for sure that I'm a very emotional person.
(To the point where I had difficulty controlling my emotions
from youth until I was middle-aged.)

I don't want to feel.
I don't want to have empathy for anyone else.
Why do we even HAVE emotions?

But we *like* the good emotions.

Right now, I need something to numb this.
If anyone knows of drugs that will help, PLEASE TELL ME.
This is not a joke. I am at the point where I'll medicate to get through this.

## Angry at God

If I didn't KNOW that God loves us, I'd think he was laughing at me.
Right now, it's hard to remember some of these things. Right now,
I'll hear that supernatural laughter and forget it's the Tormentor,
not the Lord.

"Hah! This is how your DAD felt!"

Dad is, oddly, one of the people for whom I don't have much empathy.
I don't know why. I sometimes WONDER why. I love my dad, but I don't
"feel" for him the way I feel for some people. So ... yeah ... that
thought comes to mind, "This is how HE felt, you miserable prick!".

And I know that thought is not from the Lord.
