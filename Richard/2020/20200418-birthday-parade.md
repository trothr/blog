# Birthday Parade

Today is my birthday.

I had plans. Good plans.
They had additional plans. Better than my plans.
What can I say about the kindness of friends and family?

## My Plans

I didn't expect much out of the ordinary for today.

Chelle and Martin arranged a Zoom meeting for lunch.
Been doing a lot of Zooming and Googoo Meeting.
We've had family "happy hour" courtesy of Uncle Scott.
Stuff like that.

Trent said he was going to bring me lunch.
Not expected, but ... this is a weird time,
so I just accepted the offer. Thanks bro!

I also planned to meet Susan halfway between Grove City
and Cedarville. She had made a Texas sheet cake to share with her
Texas neighbors. With me being a fellow Texan, she was kind enough
to set aside part of it.

## Their Plans

Slept late enough to be well rested.

I got to talk with Dad first thing.

Sent email to Scott Schwahn,
then got a phone call from him. He said he was planning to call anyway
and then happened to see the email from me. Great chat, always.

I caught up on other email. In particular,
a great conversation with Jim from the Grief Share group in Cedarville.

Getting close to lunch time, I avoided the front door, "social distance"
and all that. Trent said he'd bring lunch, drop it off on the front
porch, and his wife Michele has CML. I absolutely *do not* want to
expose her if I should happen to have anything. I heard Trent's car
pull up into the driveway, but then also heard horns honking.
What??

I went to the front porch and saw something like a dozen cars
circling through the cul-de-sac, signs flying, hands waving,
voices hollering "Happy Birthday!".

I was stunned.

Trent had his smart phone in record mode the whole time.
I've just never experienced anything like this. They reached out
to an empty sole during a desolate time and made him feel loved!

TURNS OUT that the kids and Diane were in on it.
TURNS OUT that Diane was the ring-leader.
TURNS OUT that Chelle and Martin had ordered Red Robin
to go along with my Red Robin lunch. (Red Robin being a
favorite among us, fitting because Marilyn would have loved it too.)

The well wishers drove off. Nancy honked louder and longer than
any of them. She said Buddy was howling along too. I thanked Trent.

I went inside to catch the Zoom lunch.
"So y'all were in on it!"

The three of us had a great visit. Chelle was grinning
over the achievement. Then Diane joined us too. Fantastic!

After Zoom, I got ready to head to London (mid-point to Cedarville).
Paul called. Had a fantastic chat with him. He was picking up his boys.
As it happens, the Thunderbirds were to fly today (Air Force Academy
graduation) and he hoped the boys would get to see them. I said,
"let's pray", so we did. Shortly after that call, Paul txted me
to say that the boys DID get to see the planes. Praise God!

Had not been to London for a long time, but found the park.
Susan arrived right after me and we chatted about our common Texas heritage,
and about the university programs, maintaining "social distance".
She brought the Texas sheet cake to my car and I gave her a Steve Camp
CD to listen to. I also had a Jeremy Camp CD (no relation) which she
already has.

Back home, I started to look through the cards and notes.
Overwhelmed.

My cousin Steve called from Virginia.
He's always good about remembering my birthday,
but often just a txt, which is fine. Sometimes it's a call,
and this time it was. Can this day get any better?

Michele Soles provided candles to go with one of the (now three!)
cakes. Chelle and Martin and I held another Zoom call as I lit
the candles and they sang.

## A Good Day

Tears again, but joy, not sadness.
Incredible to see such an outpouring.
Took away a big chunk of my aloneness.

I could wish Marilyn was here, and I do.
But even as great as this day has been, I know that her joy
is better. As much as I miss her, I would not want to take that
away. The day will come when the lot of us will be there with her
and with Jesus.

It's common for people to ask, "how are you?".
It's common for us who grieve to respond, "okay".
The goal is us who grieve to be able to say, "good".
Can't say that I've passed that mile-marker, but today was definitely "good".

I'm sitting here with a pile of cards and notes
(haven't yet been able to read them all!) and a full heart.
So exhausted, but so happy.

God has been very good to me.
He really will fill you up when you're empty.
