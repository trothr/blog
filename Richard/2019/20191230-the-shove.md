# The Shove

I lost my mission, my purpose, BEFORE I lost Marilyn.
The fact that God took her is like the shove as I sit perched
too close to the edge. I didn't mean to stray so dangerously.
I would have backed away. But that path was also hidden from me.
And now, having no reason for being, I have no companion.

Where is Romans 8:37?
Or do we simply take that out of context like so much other Scripture?

I'm failing on Hebrews 10:23.

## On the Edge

It wasn't intentional.
I've never been one to test the limits like an adrenaline junkie.
Some of it was natural: life happens. But it pushed us to a precipice.

Then God sent His escorts, carried her away, to His arms,
and knocked me over the edge. 
I'm in freefall.
