# Two Weeks Ago

I'm starting a companion blog (this one)
to accompany the tribute blog for Marilyn (my wife).
What I hope to do is focus the other on her and I'll put
personal, but perhaps unrelated, topics and posts over here.

## a Saturday morning

Today is Saturday.
It's been exactly two weeks since she slipped away from me, from us.

The house in Granger where I am staying is filled with memories.
Our own house in Grove City is filled with memories.

## Missing Her

I miss her so much.
Today I particularly miss the ability to say, "mornin darlin!".
That's the text of the last phone message from me to her on November 17.
It was a Sunday. She probably had her phone at the time, but she had
started to get the shakes and couldn't really access it.

Millions of others have gone through this same loss.
Have I done something in my own life to make it more acute?
I clung to her, but that's Biblical! I thought I was doing the right thing.

I walked today. First time in several weeks. More than a mile.
Marilyn and I wanted to start walking TOGETHER. Now I'm alone.

I've cried a lot. I'm so tired. Where is comfort?
